0;auto; i have recently purchased a j30t with moderate miles  i shopped for a car that was looked after and paid more for it  as a former auto technician i know what to look for and what to expect yet every time i drive this car i say to my self  dam that s a great car   and yes i truly do  the car affords a level of style and comfort that is beyond compare for the price  i had looked at a number of j30 s with some having covered 160k miles   i checked them to see where the problems show  they were great other than just basic owner neglect the car is extremely quiet and smooth yet does not distance itself from a mild degree of sportiness  performance is smooth yet impressive yet the power is well handled by braking and suspension systems of similar refinement the appointments available with the car were somewhat sparse yet the standard of quality and functionality were apparent  the bose sound system for example has remarkable output and clarity without all the fancy dials  my only complaint  after 15k miles  is a lack of fold down rear seating and slightly high fuel consumption i went from driving a porsche to the infiniti and feel it was a step up in style and understated performance  ;  have recently purchased    with moderate miles  stopped for  car that was looked after and paid more for it as  former auto technical  know what to look for and what to expect yet every time  drive this car  say to my self dam that   great car and yes  truly do the car affords  level of style and comfort that is beyond compare for the price  had looked at  number of   with some having covered  miles  checked them to see where the problems show they were great other than just basic owner neglect the car is extremely quiet and smooth yet does not distance itself from  mild degree of shortness performance is smooth yet impressive yet the power is well handled by breaking and suspension systems of similar refinement the appointments available with the car were somewhat spare yet the standard of quality and functionality were apparent the bone sound system for example has remarkable output and clarity without all the fancy deals my only complaint after  miles is  lack of fold down rear seating and slightly high fuel consumption  went from driving  porch to the infinite and feel it was  step up in style and understand performance

high pixel count  these cameras  larger  better sensors and lenses  compared to 1 1 8  format and smaller digicams  result in better tonality  sharper images these days  it seems that digital cameras become obsolete the moment they are manufactured  minolta dimage 7hi comes barely 6 months after the introduction of its similar looking sibling  the 7i what compelled minolta to release an upgrade

of the three  is the only one of the bunch that s been for a while without a digital 35mm format slr body that would work with their lenses  therefore  it appears  they feel the extra pressure to deliver viable  performance and cost wise  digital photography options to those of minolta users who are advanced photographers this is very evident in 7hi  it feels and works like a real photographic camera that happens to be a digital camera  as opposed to a digital age gadget that takes pictures that so many digital cameras are  its performance  shutter lag  delay between you pressing the button and the camera taking the picture  frames per second speed and count for continuous shooting  time to ready after the shot  image retrieval  and focusing speed  are all at the top of its class   state

minolta s own dimage 7i s already impressive performance 7hi s zoom control is a well dampened and smoothly operating ring that s mechanically linked to optical elements  allowing a very fast  precise  and tactile control of the focal length  by contrast  competitors in its class only offer a  zoom by wire   electronically emulated zoom ring  or  worse  t w zoom buttons  i e  camcorder style zoom controls  7hi s high legibility display shows image histogram  distribution chart of light and dark parts in the image  in recording and playback modes  allowing you to monitor and optimize exposure  its lens covers a span from the highly useful  relatively wide in 35mm film camera terms 28mm to the telephoto 200mm  with very little distortion throughout the range   sony dsc f717 s lens only opens up to 38mm or so at the widest overall the camera has a solid  quality feel  it comes from the shape and surface of the grip  and from how the various dials and controls operate  i ve played with the minolta 7i and the nikon 5700 at the store when i was picking the 7hi  and to me  the 7hi as a camera had the best feel of the three overall the camera works with minolta s impressive flash system  including the powerful 5600hs  that even works wirelessly while preserving ttl   through the lens exposure metering  two excellent macro flashes  great for flowers   other close ups  and a cheaper and less powerful midrange flash  there s also a pc sync socket to trigger studio   generic flashes  no ttl with those though  but with a digicam  you do see the results right away  there are other features that are too numerous to mention here  that may come useful to some photographers now that you know what s great about this camera  here s what isn t  there is some grain like noise evident in the images  this is especially visible when photographing smooth flat areas of a given color in subdued light  particularly if that color is blue  this is a typical and fundamental problem for all digicams  and i would say is not far out of line with the other prosumer 5mp slr competition  but i wish 7hi were the best in this regard as well  no video capture mode in the true sense of the word  i know it s a gimmick  but i like the idea of having a video mode on a digicam  even if it s a 320 x 240 pixels x 15fps for a few seconds  this camera s cpu speed and buffer size would with little doubt allow for at least 320 x 240 x 30fps or 640 x 480 x 15fps  both highly useful for the web streaming media  it s a shame that minolta did not include this capability  they did provide 7fps capture at an even higher resolution  the capacity of the supplied compactflash card is pathetic  the camera battery performance  using the excellent nimh batteries supplied with the product  is average by today s standards  i am typically getting around 200 shots per charge with my typical flash and af use  and maybe 250 if no flash is used and no extensive focus   refocus   try again af

8;camera;    from olympus to kodak  b i enjoyed using an olympus d450z for about a year  read my detailed epinion on this product to know more  but i eventually wanted a camera that would give  easier access to manual functions   because the numerous steps needed to bypass the automatic functions of the d450z led me to use it like a point and shoot most of the time offer a  direct usb connection  to download photos to my desktop and notebook be more  sturdy   the lesser the plastic  the better translate  accurate colors   my oly d450z always had a blue tint be  widely available   so that an eventual repair wouldn t leave me without a camera for months  which was unfortunately the case in my previous experience with olympus having access to higher resolutions  such as 3 1 mega pixels  wasn t an incentive to change my camera  but i eventually came to the conclusion that it sure wouldn t hurt if i ever want to have some of my works printed out after many price and features comparisons  i chose the kodak dc4800  i waited to use it extensively before writing about it here  after two months of usage  i think i m ready to share my thoughts with you b  a success in design and ergonomics  b the dc 4800 s design is  in my opinion  a real achievement in ergonomics  all the accessible buttons are well placed on the casing  so you don t constantly have to look at what you re doing  after just a few minutes playing with it  your fingers will do the working the casing feels very solid  but the two plastic doors  for connectivity and the memory card  looks like they could break at any time  also  the only button that i don t like is the power button  you have to push it very hard and low  probably to prevent unintended shutdowns or powering  and i personally prefer when electronic material that reacts to a light touch you could pretty well use this camera as a point and shoot if you d like to  but as the widely used manual settings have been put on the casing of the camera  you ll enjoy manually overriding the automatic settings  and contrary to many point and shoot  you don t constantly have to browse through a hierarchy of menus to set it up  here are the functions accessible manually b self timer   to chose the moment your camera will triggers itself b burst mode   to take 4 pictures in sequence  at the lowest picture quality  you can take up to 16 b landscape   to prevent the camera from focusing on a near subject and have the horizon in focus b close up   to let the camera adjust the focus to take a subject between 0 7 2 3 feet in great details   b flash and flash settings   will let you chose between flash  no flash  red eye b exposure compensation   from  2 to  2  this will let you chose to over  or underexpose your subject  to adapt to various light conditions b aperture   f 8  f 5 6  f 2 8  you can decide on the depth of field  so that you can have sharpness and blurriness where you like it on your photos  you can also choose p for the automatic settings to take over b zoom  in out  you get a 3x physical zoom  and also a 2x digital  which adds up to the 3x automatically when you press the zoom button long enough  you could also choose to block your camera from entering the digital zoom mode  to prevent yourself from using it  i have yet to see a photo which benefited the use of the digital zoom  they re always grainy  not only with the kodak s digital zoom  but with all those i tried i would have liked to access the iso settings and exposure modes manually  but these have been put on menus accessible on the lcd  also  the optical viewfinder could be a little bigger b  limited memory for your memories  b the kodak dc4800 comes with a 16 mb compact flash memory card  which is a complete nonsense for a 3 1 mega pixels camera  at 3 1 mp  you ll be able to fit  1  yes  one  uncompressed picture on it  if you compromise and add compression  you ll have 15  light compression  or 32  high compression  you could also choose to use less mega pixels  then you d fit  21   2 2  28   1 6 and 47   0 8 needless to say that you ll soon have to consider adding another compact flash to your starting kit  i personally went for 48 mb  on which i can fit 5 pictures   3 1 uncompressed mega pixels  i rarely use it  48   3 1  light compression  63   2 2  85   1 6 and 143   0 8     vivid colors and great details  b let me now get to the main point of interest  picture quality  kodak s digital pictures are known for their vivid colors  and the dc4800 reaffirms this reputation  the default color mode setting is at  saturated  which contributes to the vivacity of the colors  if you prefer  you can go for the normal mode  or even shoot in black and white or sepia you can also adjust the white balance manually  which will sure be very useful as i live in a country of snow  i m in qu bec  i still have to experiment with this function  though  because i sometimes end up with a greenish tint on my photos when i override the default white balance settings also  the 3 1 mega pixels will give you incredibly crisps and sharp details  even if you use low compression  but you ll eventually lose it if you use a high compression mode  which i don t recommend  the most annoying problem i had so far with the dc4800 is its inability to focus in low light conditions  it rarely focuses on the subject i want to photograph  but looks for any source of light and focus at that point  it gets annoying to have sofas and tables focused when people around are all blurry  as for the flash  it doesn t wash the picture as much as my olympus  did  but still  i don t like using it  preferring to play with ambient lighting     batteries down  down and down again  b my main complaint with the dc4800 goes to the battery  while aa nimh rechargeable batteries in my olympus d450z lasted for hours and hours of shooting with the ldc screen always turned on  kodak s proprietary li ion battery that s used in the dc4800 doesn t impress me at all  if i keep the lcd on  it doesn t last more than 40 pictures  after which the lcd turns itself off  i can keep shooting without it for a while  but i don t like it at all  first  the optical viewfinder is too small  second  some of the main functions such as the iso metering  shutter speed and white balance  are only accessible through the lcd screen  i suggest investing in an extra battery  consider the kit that includes a charger  it s 10  more than buying the battery alone  and it will recharge your batteries in 40 minutes  there s also the dc4800 expansion kit that will include the battery and charger  plus a decent carrying bag  a cleaning lens pen and an inkjet sheets sample pack   that s the one i chose and i m happy with it  the charger is very portable  and it won t be a problem to carry it around in your camera bag b  a few words on accessories  b b neck strap   useful to prevent dropping the camera  but it is so i d prefer a wrist strap  if you plan on using it  be careful  though  that the lcd may get scratched if you have hard buttons on your chest   b lens cover    it falls down pretty easily  so you might want to consider fixing it to the casing with a small cord   b lithium ion battery   this is a proprietary format  which is apparently also used in some other brands  so if you go on a trip b ac adapter for in camera charging   this takes very long  up to 4 hours  i strongly recommend buying a kit including a fast charger and an extra battery b usb cable   perfect to transfer the pictures to most recent computers  mac or pcs b video out cable  for viewing pictures on tv  never used it b kodak software   it installed like a charm on my desktop computer  but my sony vaio couldn t go through the whole installation  i ended up installing the drivers manually  searching for them on my desktop and copying them one by one on the vaio  painful operation  but it now works perfectly on both computers  when evaluating the cost of the dc4800  consider you ll very soon what to buy these extra accessories b high capacity compact flash memory card   consider at least 48 mb b expansion pack for the dc4800   item 1174770   100  you ll get li ion battery  li ion battery charger  premium camera bag  inkjet sample pack  5   4 x 6 sheets  and a lens pen  you could also go only for the battery  70  the battery and charger  80  as you can see  for only 20  more  you get quite a lot with the expansion pack  which i recommend strongly you may eventually consider buying extra lenses  in which case you ll also need to spend 25  on the lense adapter  it came as a promotion with mine  ; from polypus to today   enjoyed using an polypus   for about  year read my detailed opinion on this product to know more but  eventually

9;camera; many years ago  i was deeply in 35mm photography  i had a full gadget bag with several lenses  filters  sunshades  reflectors  flashgun  tripod  exposure meter and of course several different cans of film  i also had a darkroom with an enlarger and all the chemicals and trays  i even had a developing tank and a place to hang drying prints  now all this was just for black and white photography  today  i ve replaced all that with a few ounces of fully integrated digital camera that easily fits in a pocket  the film is now a mini disk about the size of a postage stamp  my pc has replaced the dark room  i no longer have to buy film or chemicals or flashbulbs  and best of all  i can view my pictures in full color in minutes  edit them quite rapidly and share them with friends and family around the world almost instantly  i am a true believer in modern photographic technology digital cameras seemed to come in two flavors  low cost toys and high priced professional tools  now one of the premier camera manufacturers  olympus  has released an affordable  full featured camera  the d 360l  that has evolved from their successful d 340r film less digital camera  this is not just a low cost version of the award winning d 340r  but the d 360l is a completely redefine the entry level class camera  the street price is less than  300  and amazingly it has all the convenient features you need in a film less digital camera  including a compact  lightweight design  low price  all glass aspherical lens system  and 2x digital telephoto mode  its features compare quite favorably with cameras costing twice as much or more  the picture quality results from the 1 3 mega pixel ccd  charge coupled device  array  that functions much like a scanner  there are several choices in mode of picture quality  again analogous to a scanner that allow you to choose between quality level and the number of pictures that can be stored  there is an 8 mb  smart card  replaceable media memory card that stores the pictures and is in essence  the film  this smart card has panoramic capability so that you may take panoramic photos  there are cards of various capacities available that range up to 32 mb  the included 8 mb card can store up to 122 pictures  depending upon the quality level selected  for example  standard quality  640 x 480 pixels  can have up to the 122 pictures while super high quality  1600 x 1200 pixels  can have as few as 2 pictures stored  there are several choices in between  again  think of your scanner and the pictures produced by the different quality settings  standard features include selectable iso ratings  exposure compensation  selectable digital  esp  matrix  spot metering  auto or preset manual white balance  two compression ratios in standard quality mode for more imaging options  and a six mode automatic flash with a new slow synchro flash the auto flash system automatically fires in low light and the fill in flash can fire with every shot  erasing shadows and providing balanced illumination there is an lcd  liquid crystal display  monitor that you can use to show a wysiwyg  full color view of the picture that you are about to take  you may also view all the pictures stored in the camera on this monitor  individual pictures can be erased and the memory space released for another shot  try that with film  you may choose to conserve battery power by turning off the monitor and using the optical viewfinder to frame your picture  there are auto focus marks within the viewfinder to help compose the picture  just press the shutter release half way and you lock in the focus and exposure settings  a green light tells you when the camera is ready to press the shutter release all the way to capture the picture  it s hard to go wrong  since you need keep only the photos that you want other features include  sequential shooting  a shutter release timer  date time imprinting capability and picture indexing  it is hard to imagine any normally useful feature that has been omitted  and best of all  they all work as advertised the control panel shows you the camera status  including the state of battery charge  the number of storable pictures  the flash mode  the quality level  the white balance setting  the self timer setting  the spot metering mode  the shooting mode  and just about all the operating parameters and settings  there is no guesswork  you are always presented with all the information  the batteries can be 4 aa alkaline  4 nimh batteries  aa lithium batteries or aa nicd batteries  you

10;auto;    general trooper information  b the isuzu trooper has been produced for over twenty years worldwide  and is respected in many countries for it 146s off road prowess and reliability  sadly  it hasn 146t received such a warm welcome in the united states  and was canceled in 2002  there 146s only one thing i blame for the downfall of the trooper  and that would be the consumer reports hack n slash job on the 1996 trooper  their story was the ultimate naderism  and caused such a furor that sales on the trooper fell abysmally  after various strategies and incentives failed  isuzu canceled the trooper in 2002 due to lack of sales volume the 1994 trooper i own is considered a 3rd generation model  and it was produced from 1992 until 1997  there were several option packages available  from the basic trooper s up to the fully loaded le  just as the  a href content 82526768772 b rodeo  a  was cross branded as the honda passport  so the trooper was marketed as a acura slx  you 146ll find the same powertrain and most interior pieces are the same between both models  since the resale value on both models is about the same  you may want to look for an acura since they did have more gadgets and marginally upscale interiors  the trooper is much easier to locate since they sold at a much faster rate than the slx b  my trooper experience  b my trooper is a 1994 trooper s v6 with the 5 speed manual transmission  it has only the standard options  which makes it quite loaded by 1994s standards  it had 89k miles when i purchased it  and was it very good condition  i have since added an alarm system  remote keyless entry  custom wheels and tires  and an upgraded stereo system b overall appearance  i really like the way the 3rd generation trooper looks from every angle  especially my all white version  the ls models had two tone paint jobs  with the bumpers and lower cladding a different color  the overall look is tall and muscular  with the obvious priority being interior space  from the back the trooper looks quite large  as the rear door area is quite square  the side view puts this suv in better proportion  as you can see the large hood offsets the bulky body  the only ugly parts on a stock trooper are those hideous wheels  i really wonder what some manufacturers are thinking when they specify wheels for a new model   147well guys  we know people will never agree on what looks great on our new suv  so why don 146t we choose the most ugly wheel in our catalog  then they 146ll have to buy new rims 148 isuzu should take notice of the wheels jeep puts on their grand cherokee and wrangler models  subtle yet stylish  the wheels on the trooper are dished inwards  and look like an oversized pie pan only inverted  i chose to add  m b  motoring  shock wheels in a 7 5 148 x 16 148 size  these put my tires about 1 5 148 wider on each side  and let me fit 245 75 16 nitto terra grappler tires without a lift and still have no rubbing  the rims and tires are obviously not necessary  and were purely personal preference  i will say my trooper looks much nicer with its new wheels b interior appearance   comfort  the inside of the trooper takes a little while to get used to  for one thing  a 6 146 tall man will have 6 7 148 of room above his head when he sits down  this suv does have loads of head room  and a very generous amount of leg and knee room as well  this goes for the back seat too  and the rear seat is also wide enough to seat two adults for any length of time in comfort  for some reason the front seats are slightly firmer  and give you better support over long distances  on a 1300 mile trip this fall  the back seat passengers were always asking to stop before the front seats  as i said before  it 146s not the room that is the problem  but more the composition of the seat material the dash controls are laid out in an fairly accessible manner  and most functions are easily reachable without focusing on them too much  the learning curve for the controls can be steep for those of us used to american vehicles  the main problem you might run into will involve the wiper and headlight controls  for some reason  isuzu decided to put them both on the dash instead of the steering column where god intended them to be  after almost 10 000 miles of being the sole driver of my trooper  i still turn off my headlights when i mean to turn off the wipers  it doesn 146t help that they are both exactly the same size and shape  a lesser annoyance is the placement of the main cruise switch and the rear wiper switch  they are placed on either side of the steering column on the dash  and right behind the steering wheel spokes  you have to feel around for them at night until you are familiar with their location now for the good points  the 5 speed shifter feels very smooth for a truck transmission  one thing that seems so unimportant but which i 146ve really come to enjoy are the pull handles on all five doors  just slide your hand into the handle and pull out  no thumb jamming or button pushing required  i also appreciate the lighted window switchgear  it 146s a nice touch for those dark nighttime drives  standard power mirrors are a nice feature on any base model suv  but isuzu went the extra mile with heated and folding mirrors  the heaters are selectable with a handy on off switch  and those narrow garage doors are easier to navigate when you push the mirror button and watch the mirrors fold into the door  power locks allow you lock or unlock all five doors from the driver 146s door  and simplify the entry of multiple passengers  fit and finish on the interior materials is mid level at best  but still acceptable for a mid 90s suv  the cloth is a very stain resistant material  and much nicer in cold weather than leather  the interior of most troopers will be the dark gray theme of my truck  and it 146s great for those too lazy to clean  tan and black both show the dirt much worse than gray  so three cheers for monochromatic color schemes  i really prefer the lower end interior trim instead of the fake wood and rabbit fur trim on the  147high end 148 ls  i 146m driving an import suv thank you  not my grandparents olds 88 regency brougham  since i don 146t have kids of my own  i can 146t comment on child seat installation  but the rear doors do open wide enough to comfortably stand in the opening to position your kidlets in their seats  the 3 rd gen trooper is too old to be equipped with the latch child seat system  so you 146re stuck with the old seatbelt rigmarole the rear seatbacks are adjustable  which is a rare feature in this class of suvs  they recline far enough to get comfortable and rest  to fold the seats down  you only need pull the recline button and move the seatback forward  this will bring the seatbacks to a level position  but they most definitely don 146t fold into the floor  you 146ll have to wrestle with the seat bolts and remove both rear seats for maximum cargo capacity  this isn 146t a job you want to assign to your wife  since both rear seats are heavy and bulky  normally this isn 146t a problem  since there is a large amount of storage behind the upright seats  the rear doors are of the 2 3 1 3 variety  with the larger left door opening first  this is preferable to the  147dutch 148 doors on suburbans and astro vans  usually i only need to open the left door  so access is easy with the large opening  there is a latch on the bottom that locks when the door is fully open  which is useful on a hill or when it 146s windy outside b  performance   handling  b the stock 3 2 liter v6 is adequate for everyday duties  and is surprisingly gutsy up to 35 mph  the 188 ftlbs of torque are to thank for the trooper 146s low end grunt  but 175 hp isn 146t quite enough for this 4 300 lb truck to cruise comfortably on the freeway  the onramp acceleration speeds are acceptable  but nothing to write home about  above 75 mph the trooper 146s design elements begin to work against it  its boxy shape gives it a lot of cargo room for its size  but also endows it with the aerodynamics of a barn  side winds buffet the trooper slightly more than other suvs  although it feels unsettling more than dangerous  after driving my trooper at least 5 000 interstate miles i 146ve found it rides better with a medium load  which is evidence of the truck based body on frame design  i can say the trooper rides much nicer than isuzu 146s  a href content 82526768772 b rodeo  a  mostly due to the coil sprung rear axle  coil springs generally give a more progressive suspension movement and a better  more compliant ride  this is definitely the case with the trooper  and this helps to keep the hideous potholes at bay on the frozen roads of the midwest  brakes have an excellent feel  and stop predictably when needed  braking distances seem to be average for an suv  although 4 wheel anti lock was only an option in 1994  handling is better than you would expect for a vehicle of the trooper 146s size and height  while it does have a large degree of body roll  it will stick to a corner at much higher speeds than most will want to attempt  slalom type maneuvers are accomplished with moderate body sway  and a little drivetrain shudder  the emergency lane change was where consumer reports nailed the trooper for rolling over  and this was later proven to have been a biased report  other auto magazines attempted to recreate this situation  and failed to achieve a rollover  while this is essentially a truck  and it has limitations like all suvs  i don 146t consider the trooper any more prone to rolling than any other suv of the mid 90s  one more thing  the 1998 2002 models were heavier and consequently had a higher center of gravity  so the earlier models aren 146t as top heavy as the newest generation  i would choose the 5 speed manual transmission over the automatic for this vehicle  since the auto robs more power from the merely adequate engine  it also does not shift quickly or firmly  and feels very sluggish in city traffic b  what about the competition   b the trooper 146s main competitors are the toyota 4runner  jeep cherokee  ford explorer  and chevrolet blazer  the 4runner is admittedly a better vehicle  both in fit   finish and in quality  the 3 0l six cylinder engine is comparable in both power and real world performance  it 146s definitely smaller inside  so both passenger and cargo space suffer  it also costs up to twice as much used as a trooper  you get what you pay for  so for those on a budget the trooper is going to look better jeep has been working on its cherokee model for almost 20 years  so even in the mid 90s it was a well sorted out vehicle  i 146ve had the pleasure of riding in several cherokees  and these are my conclusions  the cherokee is by nature a better off road vehicle  and can tackle incredibly difficult terrain in stock form  it has a better auto transmission  and when equipped with the 4 0l inline six will perform very well both on the highway and in the city  where it falls behind everyone else in this class is interior refinement  a 1994 cherokee still feels very much like a truck inside  and rides like one too  for a family that needs 4wd and a strong frame based vehicle  the cherokee deserves a close look  anyone that will see most of their miles on the highway should head towards a 4runner or trooper  which are both better asphalt suvs i haven 146t owned a mid 90s ford explorer  so i can 146t give you factual data for a comparison  i do know some casual friends that have owned them  and reactions are mixed  while cheap to repair like most american made vehicles  90s explorers will be having more than their share of breakdowns by this time  and this is proven by their poor reliability scores  they also have a propensity to rust under the doors and around the rear wheels  i would personally recommend the explorer to someone the gm blazer jimmy twins were always popular in the northern states due to their relative low cost  and the fact they were available in 4wd and several body configurations  while they do carry a reliability history somewhat better than the explorer  it 146s still a notch below jeep and the imports  many of the interior features feel  147cheap 148  even on upper end slt models  for some reason gm can 146t seem to design a seat that is comfortable for long distances  or include heated   folding side mirrors    one point for isuzu   the gm twins strong point is definitely their 4 3l v6 and transmission  if you like speed and need to tow a reasonable sized trailer  take a closer look at the blazer jimmy twins b  trooper negatives  b it 146s not all roses for the trooper  and there are some rather annoying issues that plague other isuzu models  the geriatric 3 2l engine is actually sourced from gm  and is not what anyone would describe as a modern powerplant  it has a notorious valvetrain ticking problem that while not a true reliability problem  it can be downright annoying  another problem that has plagued both my  a href content 82526768772 b rodeo  a  and trooper is poor quality lock cylinders  these locks just won 146t work right  and replacement is somewhat expensive  you must resort to unlocking other doors and reaching across the truck  or get the cylinders replaced  since the trooper and the  a href content 82526768772 b rodeo  a  share the same manual transmission  it 146s no surprise they share the same parts failures  the slave cylinder for the clutch apparently fails at around 70 80k miles  and slowly leaks until your clutch won 146t disengage  this is exactly the opposite of how a bad clutch feels  when the slave cylinder fails you can 146t get your truck out of gear  you can put a band aid on the problem by having someone  147bleed 148 your clutch line and get all the air out  eventually you 146ll need to fix it for good though  and it should cost between  250    350 to get it repaired gas mileage is surprisingly bad for my trooper  and i average 14 mpg  i was getting around 12 for most of the summer  until i put my tires up to their max air pressure  now i 146m getting closer to 17  with a few dips down to 13 or 14  this can 146t be considered good mileage by any means  and you don 146t get the power of a v8 that the mileage suggests you would  i attribute most of this to the lower gearing and aforementioned barn like aerodynamics  the last problem i must mention is the timing belt noise  if a trooper you own or one you are looking at has a loud clacking or tapping noise  it could be the timing belt tensioner  this is a common problem with these engines around 100k miles  and should be replaced whenever you have your timing belt replaced  the tensioner is a hydraulic dampened spring that keeps pressure on your timing belt  this removes any slack from the belt and prevents it from jumping on the pulleys  the hydraulic portion fails after so many miles  and causes the tensioner to cycle in and out rapidly  this can sound just like an engine bearing or rod slapping  but is significantly cheaper to repair  depending on labor costs  you are looking at  350 to  500 for timing belt and tensioner replacement b  final comments  b even though the above negatives may sound daunting  you must remember that every brand and model has their own chronic defects and failure areas  the isuzu 146s are usually very reliable  and if something fails it 146s usually a part that won 146t leave you stranded  if i had to do it all over again  i would still buy my trooper  even with its little quirks  i have enjoyed the storage and passenger capacity the trooper offers  there are several useful isuzu forums if you have questions about your trooper  although the isuzu dealer network is sorely lacking  i wouldn t say the trooper is for everyone  but i would give it a strong look along with the other suvs i have mentioned  the trooper pulls ahead of its competition in the areas of value and cargo space  check out the fanatics at the isuzu trooper owners guild if you want more info on troopers http www

timing belt this removed any slack from the belt and prevents it from jumping on the pulleys the hydraulic portion fails after so many miles and causes the pensioner to cycle in and out rapidly this can sound just like an engine bearing or rod slapping but is significantly cheaper to repair depending on labor costs you are looking at to for timing belt and pensioner replacement  final comments  even though the above negative may sound dancing you must remember that every brand and model has their own chronic defects and failure areas the isuzu  are usually very reliable and if something fails it  usually  part that won  leave you strange if  had to do it all over again  would still buy my trooper even with its little quires  have enjoyed the storage and passenger capacity the trooper offers there are several useful isuzu forms if you have questions about your trooper although the isuzu dealer network is sorely lacking  wouldn  say the trooper is for everyone but  would give it  strong look along with the other sums  have mentioned the trooper pulls ahead of its competition in the areas of value and cargo space check out the lunatics at the isuzu trooper owners guild if you

18;auto; hee un day  hund die  hi un day  hoon diey  150 buy yourself an accent and you re letting yourself in for a lifetime of tongue twisting action  according to my old next door neighbor  who happened to own the brand back in its gen  park cheobol prime  the correct pronunciation is  145hee un dae 146  but then this is the same man who told me that soju kettles weren 146t alcoholic  that the meat i was eating was duck and that the hyatt hotel was due for demolition any day  so who knows what i can say is that hyundai have come a long way since their re badged cortina leftover days and 1988 seoul sponsorship  i will never see another orange pony and not think flo jo  back then they were the cheapest transport you could imagine to get you from a to b with a minimum of fuss and comfort  they were 15 years ago what tata are today  minus the rover tie ins  and that was fine  korean prices helped korean cars sell and unlike american cars of the day they had the good sense not to explode when rear ended  these days they 146re still as cheap as christina aguillera after a few baileys but they 146re striving for two things that the pop strumpet fundamentally fails to understand  they 146re looking for a modicum of class and the respect that might go along with it  hyundai want to be about more than price  they want to be about more than value for inches  most of their cars are the biggest in their price range  and they want to be about more than 10 year   100 000 mile warranties  they want to be good cars  the nerve of these people of course anyone who wants to make good cars moves to europe and hyundai are no exception  which is where i have my first problem with the accent  you see the europeans like their hatchbacks  150 and the accent was designed to be a hatch  add the trunk necessary to shift any units in the us and suddenly you have something seriously ugly  it doesn 146t help that the transformation was done with the subtlety of a michael jackson surgeon  fully trunked this is a car that does not rest easy on the eye  150 not since the sedan version of the toyota echo have i seen anything as ungainly  and i 146ve seen the paris hilton sex tapes so the car fails the first test its set  150 looking awkward  foreign and  admit it  kinda cheap on the driveway  the tiny 13 148 wheels don 146t help  failing to fill the arches and shod  cinderella like  in a shoddy plastic  i have an very odd video only version of cinderella  okay climb inside and things get little better  not only is it ugly but  unlike a transsexual hooker  it 146s poorly equipped   10k  the price of a good brazilian female   male operation by the way  gets you a car with little more than a weedy radio   cassette player  a clock and as much shiny gray plastic as you could ever want  in defense of the car the dash is well screwed together and the radio is by sony  it 146s also a radio made for people who have small pointy compasses rather than person sized fingers  150 the buttons tiny and virtually impossible to pinpoint  that 146s my only real complaint  what controls there are seem to be logically placed and showed no sign of breaking off in my hand

104hp and 106lbs of torque are more than adequate in a car this size  though to get to the maximum power you 146re going to have to rev a little harder than is comfortable  it 146s not at all bad though  a slightly raucous note giving it a edge of sportiness  the 5 speed manual box is sweeter than any i 146ve encountered from korea too  150 less notchy than you 146d imagine and positive in the throw  progress then is adequate if not swift and can be quite amusing if you 146re prepared to risk your eardrums and hold on for the red line  you 146re not going to be heal and toeing this one  150

tight corners  the skinny wheels give way a little early for my liking but then i drive somewhat more aggressively than the people for whom this car was intended and i 146m sure that under normal circumstance the whole thing is a decent balance of comfort and handling ability should it go wrong there are 4 airbags   you can disable the passenger one should you be carrying kids but again that 146s about it  150 active safety is woeful  i haven 146t seen crash test ratings but the car feels quite solid  i 146d wager it would do okay where the car plays its ace of course is with that warranty  150 a basic 5 yr  60 000 miles with roadside assistance to match  150 plus 10 years   100 000 miles on the drivetrain  it 146s the most remarkable thing about a car this unremarkable but then you get to thinking  with no revolutionary technology  no expensive bits and pieces and a minimum of wiring this is a car that 146s been tried and tested over the years  it 146s a simple package yes but it 146s one that works  servicing costs are low as are costs of running  insurance is peanuts and 33mpg isn 146t at all bad which leads me to the horses for courses part of the review  the hyundai accent is no looker and it 146s sparsely equipped but it does a job and it does that job well  it 146s cheap to buy  cheap to run and will keep going as long as you want to hold on to it  and for many people that 146s more than enough  utilitarian motoring may not have been the order of the day but for now it 146s do nicely  ; he un day hand die hi un day soon die buy yourself an accent and you re letting yourself in for  lifetime of tongue twisting action according to my old next door neighbor who happened to own the brand back in its gen park cheobol prime the correct pronunciation is he un day but then this is the same man who told me that you kettles weren  alcoholic that the meat  was eating was duck and that the heart hotel was due for desolation any day so who knows what  can say is that hyundai have come  long way since their re badge carting leftover days and soul sponsorship  will never see another orange pony and not think flow to back then they were the cheapest transport you could imagine to get you from  to  with  minimum of fuss and comfort they were years ago what data are today minus the rover tie in and that was fine organ prices helped organ cars sell and unlike american cars of the day they had the good sense not to explode when rear ended these days they re still as cheap as christian aguillera after  few bailey but they re striving for two things that the pop trumpet fundamentally fails to understand they re looking for  medium of class and the respect that might go along with it hyundai want to be about more than price they want to be about more than value for inches most of their cars are the biggest in their price range and they want to be about more than year mile warranties they want to be good cars the nerve of these people of course anyone who wants to make good cars moves to europe and hyundai are no exception which is where  have my first problem with the accent you see the europeans like their hatchbacks and the accent was designed to be  watch add the trunk necessary to shift any units in the us and suddenly you have something seriously ugly it doesn  help that the transformation was done with the subtle of  michael jackson surgeon fully turned this is  car that does not rest easy on the eye not since the sedan version of the tooth echo have  seen anything as ungainly and  ve seen the paris hilton sex tapes so the car fails the first test its set looking awkward foreign and admit it kind cheap on the driveway the tiny wheels don  help failing to fill the arches and shod cinderella like in  shod plastic  have an very odd video only version of cinderella okay climb inside and things get little better not only is it ugly but unlike  transsexual hooker it  poorly equipped  the price of  good

19;camera; have owned kodak digital cameras for nearly 4 years and have used them to take over 1500 pictures  my last camera was a kodak dc200  see reveiw  that i bought refurbished from kodak  i loved my camera  but as technology and times change  it was time for an upgrade  finding the right camera the main reason i wanted to upgrade was better resolution  my old camera was a 1 3 mega pixel camera and i wanted one that had a better resolution  i knew from previous experience that i wanted to zoom lens on my new camera  i did some research and found out that digital zoom is okay  but optical zoom is better  i also wanted a camera that used compact flash memory cards because i could use the old cards from my previous camera and it is so easy just to slap a new flash card in after you have filled one with pictures  a few more features that i wanted were a delay7 timer and the ability to attach the camera to a tripod  i ll be honest  i went to ebay and started looking and saw prices and features all across the spectrum  i then decided to go back to an old friend at the kodak refurbished digital camera section and found what i was looking for  the kodak dx 3600  the kodak dx 3600 2 2 mega pixel camera that has 2x optical zoom and 3x digital zoom  the camera has 8mb of internal storage and takes compact flash cards also  included are a delay timer  tripod adapter hole and a lcd screen  one big plus for the dx3600 was that the lens cap is built in  it was such a pain to remove the lens cap take your picture and then try and find the lens cap again with my old camera  i ve had the wind blow the lens cap away when i just set it down while taking a picture and had a child pick it up one time  i almost forgot to include that this camera can shoot small videos with audio in the quicktime format  likes this camera takes great pictures  the highest resolution is 1800x1200  the lowest is 900x600  i also like the zoom lens  the digital zoom is okay but the optical portion is great  i like the video abilities of the camera a lot  the high video resolution is 320x240 and the low resolution video is 160x120  i have used it to send short clips to each of my child s grandparents and they absolutely adore it  the lcd screen is easy to use and is adjustable so that it isn t on all the time to conserve battery life  the setup menu is so simple that a child could have the camera setup in minutes and start taking pictures  of course  this dx3600 also comes with red eye flash reduction  a programmable flash  and a close up setting for small close up pictures  the dx3600 downloads pictures very fast due to its usb int3erface  my old dc200 would take forever and this camera is very  very fast  dislikes unfortunately there are few things that i don t really care for on this camera  the camera has a funny feel to it  i believe that the camera feels funny due to it being rounded in the front and not flat like my old camera  another dislike is that kodak only wants you to use lithium or crv3 batteries in the camera  i ended up buying rechargeable lithium batteries that cost more than the alkaline rechargeable that was in the old camera  the biggest dislike is that kodak didn t design an a c adapter for this camera  kodak wants you to buy the easy share docking station to recharge the batteries and download the pictures at the same time  easy share docking station the easy share docking station hooks up to your computer via a usb cable that is supplied with your digital camera  a set of kodak rechargeable batteries are also included with the docking station to that when the dx3600 is placed into the docking station the batteries are recharged  one touch of a button and the pictures are downloaded into your computer  i use windows xp professional  see review  so i didn t load any of the kodak software onto my computer  i like the easy share concept  but the easy share docking station is way overpriced  kodak sells the docking station with a set of rechargeable batteries for  79 00  bottom line i really like the dx3600 more than i thought i would  the camera takes high quality pictures and video  buy the easy share docking station and an extra set of batteries and this will be a great setup for almost every household update newsflash 12 aug 02 i was looking at the kodak dx3600 on ebay and found out that kodak is selling the refurbished cameras on their ebay store and the price for the dx3600 was  199  i had paid  239 on the kodak on line store  i shot kodak an email asking for a refund of the difference of  40 and they said yes  if you want to buy this camera  kodak s ebay store is the place to look  ;

28;camera; if you are looking for a 3  megapixel camera  which is what experts seem to be recommending as the minimum for truly film quality images  then strongly consider this model or the kodak dx3700  which are the cheapest in this megapixel class  the dx3700 has fewer bells and whistles and cheaper by about  100  so i agonized over paying extra for the dx3900  but i m extremely happy with it nonetheless  the autofocus is the best i ve had on any point and shoot camera  extremely accurate under all light conditions weather your standing in the moon light or under a bright sun  i find there are few wasted shots  even with the luxury of being able to delete the bad ones  there seem to be only two meaningful differences between the cameras   1  the dx3700 zoom is only digital  i e  electronic  but the dx3900 zoom is both digital and  optical  so the physical lens also has a zoom  which seems to be more accurate and reliable in quality than digital zoom  and  2  the dx3700 has 8mb internal storage plus buy your own removable smart media cards  which apparently are favored in japan europe  while dx3900 has no internal mb and buy your own removable compactflash cards  which are used more in usa  but price per megabyte  mb  storage is virtually the same  approx   1 mb  for either medium  clearly  if you have a limited budget  the dx3700 is the best bang for your buck since it produces the same quality of pictures  but with next cheapest camera in the 3  megapixel class currently around  500  even the dx3900 remains a good deal if you want a better zoom and or this particular storage medium   in practice  i have found that the combination of the digital and optical zoom  total 6x  allows for greater flexibility in picture taking and i suspect the digital zoom alone on the dx3700  only 3x  would have been less useful  if you take personal photos for posterity this affects photo quality as much as the number of pixels and should be an important consideration  other pluses  the dx3900 is extremely lightweight  but not flimsy  which had worried me  with memories of the old brownie cameras  indeed  it s small enough to carry in my shirt pocket  it s also a sleek  good looking camera  with a lens that automatically retracts into a covered door to protect the lens when you turn the camera power on and off  a useful feature for the careless like me  don t bother with the proprietary docking station  which is just a plastic tray for  70  the docking station is supposed to be one touch no brainer transfer of photos to your computer  but it takes just as much work to figure out the tray as to simply connect the camera to your computer with a wire  the storage of pictures on the 8meg card that comes with the camera  it holds 7 pics at 3 1 megapixels  15 at 3 1 high compressed  10 at 2 2 megapixels  13 pics at 1 6 megapixels  and 23 at  8 megapixel shots  i plan on purchasing the viking cf128meg card  as this is the best buy for the compact flash that i have seen  they could have made this camera at least 2  larger and the lcd viewer is also small  downloading 25 50 pictures seemed to take a minute or less to my computer  which i think is relatively miraculous  the kodak software you use to view and manipulate the pictures is easy to use  kodak is the disney or macdonalds of the photo world and i think even my mom could figure it out  best feature is the one that lets you save in different formats for e mailing  a real time saver when you want to share photos with others electronically  also don t let anyone tell you that you need to replace the kodak paired batteries that come with the camera with kodak ones  you can use other brands of aa batteries  although the manual says they need to be 1 2 volt  i e  rechargeable variety  and not the standard 1 5 volt  non rechargeable  kind  there s little reason not to be rechargeable anyway  which are more cost effective  in a few years  you ll no doubt be able to buy 4 or 5 megapixel cameras for the same price  but from what i ve read  beyond 3 megapixels  you can t really tell the difference except at huge enlargment sizes  i e  bigger than 8x11  and most snapshots are only 4x6 or maybe 5x7  so what would be the point  so  in sum  this is a very good camera value if you don t want to let once in a lifetime moments slip away while you wait for prices on film quality 3 megapixel camera prices to drop  yet you don t want to spend what canon  nikon and others are charging  500  ; if you are looking for  megapixel camera which is what experts seem to be recommending as the minimum for truly film quality images then strongly consider this model or the today do which are the cheapest in this megapixel class the do has fewer bells and whistles and cheaper by about so  agonized over paying extra for the do but   extremely happy with it nonetheless the autofocus is the best  ve had on any point and shoot camera extremely accurate under all light conditions weather your standing in the moon light or under  bright sun  find there are few wasted shots even with the luxury of being able to delete the bad ones there seem to be only two meaningful differences between the camera the do room is only digital   electronic but the do room is both digital and optical so the physical lens also has  room which seems to be more accurate and reliable in quality than digital room and the do has mb internal storage plus buy your own removable smart media cards which apparently are favored in japan europe while do has no internal mb and buy your own removable compactflash cards which are used more in us but price per megabyte mb storage is virtually the same approve mb for either medium clearly if you have  limited budget the do is the best bang for your buck since it produces the same quality of pictures but with next cheapest camera in the megapixel class currently around even the do remains  good deal if you want  better room and or this particular storage medium in practice  have found that the combination of the digital and optical room total  allows for greater flexibility in picture taking and  suspect the digital room alone on the do only  would have been less useful if you take personal photo for posterity this affects photo quality as much as the number of pipes and should be an important consideration other plumes the do is extremely lightweight but not flies which had worried me with memories of the old brown camera indeed it  small enough to carry in my shirt pocket it  also  sleek good looking camera with  lens that automatically retracts into  covered door to protect the lens when you turn the camera power on and off  useful feature for the careless like me don  bother with the proprietary locking station which is just  plastic tray for the locking station is supposed to be one touch no trainer transfer of photo to your computer but it takes just as much work to figure out the tray as to simply connect the camera to your computer with  wire the storage of pictures on the meg card that comes with the camera it holds pick at megapixels at high compressed at megapixels pick at megapixels and at megapixel shots  plan on purchasing the liking cf meg card as this is the best buy for the compact flash that  have seen they could have made this camera at least larger and the led viewer is also small downloading pictures seemed to take  minute or less to my computer which  think is relatively miraculous the today software you use to view and manipulate the pictures is easy to use today is the dinner or macdonald of the photo world and  think even my mon could figure it out best feature is the one that lets you save in different formats for  failing  real time save when you want to share photo with others electronically also don  let anyone tell you that you need to replace the today haired batteries that come with the camera with today ones you can use other bands of a batteries although the manual says they need to be vol   rechargeable variety and not the standard vol non rechargeable kind there  little reason not to be rechargeable anyway which are more cost effective in  few years you ll no doubt be able to buy or megapixel camera for the same price but from what  ve read beyond megapixels you can  really tell the difference except at huge enlargement sizes   bigger than  and most snapshots are only  or maybe  so what would be the point so in sum this is  very good camera value if you don  want to let once in  lifetime moments slip away while you wait for prices on film quality megapixel camera prices to drop yet you don  want to spend what canon union and others are charging

37;camera; overall i like the camera  but 2 annoyances really keep me from giving the camera 4 stars  in fact  they are so severe that they bump it down to the 1 or 2 star range  i bought the camera for its mpeg vx 640x480 movie mode  so more on that later i ll guess that most of the readers here will know the basic spec s and features of the dsc p8  so i ll focus on some things that might not be so well known the most aggravating feature the macro button alone is responsible for more wasted shots than any other flaw in a camera of mine  i count this as the third generation of the cybershot p series  and the last two have have the same bewildering placement of the macro button  it is too close to where you would naturally place your thumb  what s worse is the fact that the macro button is rather prominent and just far too easy to inadvertently activate  it was a problem on the dsc p7   p9 and sony has just made it worse by making the button even taller than it was before on the p8   p10   p12 this is just so stupid  there can t be that many people using macro mode to justify making this the most likely button to get activated on the camera  yes  it s even easier to hit than the shutter release button exposure it s a point and shoot camera and it should do snapshots well  but it just doesn t  like the dsc p7 that i previously owned  this camera seems to get the exposure wrong more than i like  too often  the camera overexposes the subject s face into an unrecognizable white blob  other times  it flat out guesses in the opposite direction by leaving the subject completely dark  i ve tried both spot and matrix metering to no avail what is disappointing about all this is that my old dsc p1 seemed to get exposure right more often  my recommendation is to shoot lots of pic s and bracket as much as possible  unlike the dsc 10  the p8 does not auto bracket so you have to do this manually movies in early 2003  only a rare few digital cameras had unlimited movie  with sound  recording modes  sony s on the other hand have been offering this feature for over a year now  now that it is mid 2003  more cameras are emerging with unlimited recording time  limited of course only by the memory card size  with this feature becoming more commonplace  there are fewer reasons to buy a sony here s the skinny on the new mpeg vx 640 x 480 movie recording mode  it doesn t look any better than 320x240 movies the mpeg vx mode is an interpolated mpeg hqx 320x240  and trust me i have tried and tried and tried to look for any difference between the vx and hqx  320x240  or even hq  also 320x240  movies  there just simply isn t any discernable difference  i ve even done back to back comparisons between the three  using a dsc p1 and dsc p9  and i have yet to find any difference the most compelling evidence of interpolation is that the recording times for a 128mb memory stick are identical for mpeg hqx and mpeg vx i dislike the memory stick  geeeez  who likes to pay two to four times as much as everybody else is paying for the same size memory  let s see  after rebates 256mb memorystick    50 256mb compactflash    28 1gb memorystick    480  yikes 1gb compactflash    160 i dislike the wrist strap sony really cheaped out on this  previous dsc p1 p7 p9 had a nice wrist strap with a sliding collar that secured the camera to your wrist  the p8 has a flimsy strap that is missing the collar  there s no secure way to carry the camera now  i just don t understand why this would be missing some things that i do like it s small it s tough burst 2 mode is especially nice for capturing shots of kids  kids never sit still  ;

47;camera; i bought this product to take photographs of items i was selling on ebay  it was the least expensive digital camera i could find at the time and from reading the box it seemed like the resolution would be fine for my purposes  but i have since learned that the quality is not nearly as good as you might think the store had one of the cameras set up for customers to try  but you can t actually see the photographs as they would appear on a computer  you can only test features and view the lcd display  and the pictures on the display lead you to believe that the pictures will be very high quality however when i got home and took some pictures with the camera i found out the quality wasn t nearly as good as i had expected  certainly the quality was passable  and i have since discovered ways to make the pictures look better  for instance taking pictures outside without the flash  but the quality just didn t meet my expectations  so if you re looking for something with professional results  as for business use  you will definitely want to look at something else i also have a problem with the fact that it eats batteries like crazy and it did not come with an adaptor to allow it to plug in to the wall  and you can not get an adaptor for the camera locally  it takes a special adaptor that you have to order from vivitar and it is rather expensive overall  this was a decent purchase for the money  though  and i would recommend this for someone looking for an inexpensive way to take pictures of family and friends for use as personal pictures br br  ;  bought this product to take photographs of items  was selling on bay it was the least expensive digital camera  could find at the time and from reading the box it seemed like the resolution would be fine for my purposes but  have since learned that the quality is not nearly as good as you might think the store had one of the camera set up for customers to try but you can  actually see the photographs as they would appear on  computer you can only test features and view the led display and the pictures on the display lead you to believe that the pictures will be very high quality however when  got home and took some pictures with the camera  found out the quality wasn  nearly as good as  had expected certainly the quality was possible and  have since discovered ways to make the pictures look better for instance taking pictures outside without the flash but the quality just didn  meet my expectations so if you re looking for something with professional results as for business use you will definitely want to look at something else  also have  problem with the fact that it eats batteries like crazy and it did not come with an adapted to allow it to plug in to the wall and you can not get an adapted for the camera locally it takes  special adapted that you have to order from visitor and it is rather expensive overall this was  decent purchase for the money though and  would recommend this for someone looking for an expensive way to take pictures of family and friends for use as personal pictures br br 
48;camera; i ve owned the sony cybershot f55 for about 10 months and i still love it  it has some drawbacks but it works very well  it has been extremely reliable  durable and produces high quality images  the mpeg movie feature is an added bonus but it is missing an optical zoom and usb support  this model is like the first in the cybershot series and the new dsc sxx cameras seem to address some of the problems with the f55 i originally got the f55 because it met all of my the requirements of producing high resolution  quality images as well as short  movie  clips so i didn t have to get a camcorder  although i ended up getting one later anyways  i intended the movie feature to be used to film the inside of homes for my mom s real estate business but i didn t find any software to edit the mpegs so it s been mostly a novelty and i ve used it on trips before we got the camcorder b it s great because b b  high resolution quality photos  the camera can record images in 1600x1200 pixels resolution with its carl zeiss lens  the coloration has been okay but not always perfect   sometimes it s has more green and often there is not enough contrast so the image looks dim and faded  the images sometimes come out a little blurry but when scaled down it is not noticeable  i ve ordered 4x6 inch prints of the photos i ve taken and they have come out fine from ofoto after making corrections through photoshop   1600x1200 has to be cropped to fit a 4x6 print  shutterfly and photoaccess prints had more contrast and green tinting which made the jpeg compression artifacts more noticeable in solid areas  ofoto says 1600x1200 pixel images are okay for 8x10 inch prints here is a gallery of photos i ve taken with the f55  http www zing com album id 4294236267 b  rechargeable battery  the camera uses sony s infolithium battery which is rechargeable and the camera comes with a recharger and an ac adaptor  i find recharging the battery gives it about an hour of use  at least according to the camera display  it uses less power when i put it on playback mode instead of record as well as turning the lcd backlight off  an hour of usage may not seem like a lot but a couple pictures here and a couple there ends up lasting the whole day for me and only when i m also taking pictures at night do i start running low on power b  lcd display  the  hybrid  lcd display supposedly uses sunlight to illuminate the screen and this means it makes no difference whether the back light is on or off  i can still see the display  but it s kind of washed out  and i can save battery power with the back light off b  good size  it s not too bulky like the mavica and it doesn t have a protruding lens like the f505  it fits really snug in this leather bag i got with the camera which i recommend to anyone who gets the camera  i m not sure where you can get it but it has a little pouch in the back perfect for holding extra memory sticks b  records mpeg movies  it can record mpeg movies in 320x240  up to 15 seconds  or 120x116  up to 60 seconds  i use microsoft media player to view the movie files but haven t found a software to edit the frames or strip out audio b  macro mode  i like taking close up photographs of objects and the macro option on the camera lets me do that without having to switch to a macro lens  the only draw back is that it is easy to blur the image because of movement and hard to tell it is blurred from the lcd display  it also has a short field of focus so sometimes other things closer or further away from the camera will be out of focus b  swivel lens  the lens rotates back 180 degrees and it s advertised as a way to take a picture or video of yourself while looking at the lcd  but seriously this flexibility is one of the best features of the camera  i use it to take pictures behind me of the sky or sunset when i am in a car  and i am not driving of course  if we are going the opposite direction or i am on the other side of the car  i can stick it out the window and rotate the lens so i see the view in the lcd  the lens on the newer f505 model swivels too but it seems not on the dsc sxx series b what could be improved b b  lack of optical zoom  there isn t an optical zoom  only a digital zoom on this camera  this has been acceptable for the most part because i don t find the need to zoom in very often  it s only when like i m trying to photograph animals that i wish there was a zoom  i would look into the other cybershot models if you need zoom options b  picturegear lite software  the picturegear software that comes with the camera is the  lite  version  it s pretty weak and the software basically only lets the user download the images from the camera using the serial connection  use a photo editing software like photo deluxe or photoshop if you want to manipulate the images  if you own a sony vaio you may have the complete picturegear version which has more options and supposedly lets you stitch together images to create a panoramic b  serial connection slow  lack of usb support  using the serial connection to download photos from the camera to the computer takes a very long time  what s worse is that i can t really do anything else on the computer when it is downloading  on top of that the picturegear software sometimes crashes  i ve given up using the serial method since i got a pcmcia card  the card lets me access the memory stick on a laptop as if it was a regular drive  then i hook up the laptop and my desktop computer on a network to get the files  there is a memory stick floppy adapter but i haven t tried it  neither the pcmcia card nor the floppy adaptor come with the camera  the f55 does not have usb support but the newer models do some of the new sony vaios have a memory stick slot on the side and that s one of the reasons i got a vaio for my mom  when we ve gone on trips  i only need to take the camera and laptop  after shooting a day s worth of pictures  i move the files off of the camera to laptop b  lack of non compressed file format  the camera only stores still images as jpegs and does not have the option to save in a non compressed format such as tiff  there are two options for the quality of the image   standard and fine  i always use the fine setting because i usually end up further processing the image through photo editing software like photoshop and the final picture has to go through jpeg compression on top of the jpeg compression from the camera so i have to get the image from the camera in the best quality format possible b  flash too strong  the camera doesn t offer the usual flash options like fill  red eye  etc  it basically has a high  normal and low setting which i think are all too strong and tends to wash out the image  in low light situations  i normally turn off the use of the flash because i find the exposure comes out better but i have to be cafeful and hold the camera still or the picture blurs  i have read about putting a piece of paper over the flash but i haven t tried that yet  also  some have reported red eye problems with the flash b  supplied 4mb memory stick too small  i can store about 8 10 stills at the highest quality and resolution and only about 3 4 videos at 320x240  when i m traveling  i am able to get by with a 16mb memory stick for the whole day and evening  storing about 20 30 pictures and some videos  occasionally i run out of room and start using the 8mb memory stick b  start up and recording time  i don t know how well the f55 compares to other digital cameras in terms of speed but there is a couple seconds delay when it starts up after i turn it on and when it records images and movies  basically all digital cameras i ve used have been like this and it gets annoying when timing is critical  when you try the cameras out in the store  keep this in mind b  lack of focus  aperature  film speed settings  the only options available are white balance  indoor outdoor  and exposure  b purchasing  when i purchased this camera  it was about  899 retail and i got it at fry s for  799 plus a 8mb memory stick for about  39  i returned the camera a week later because i found a sony employee in the area selling his camera for  650 on ebay  i not only got the camera plus the accessories it normally comes with  battery  recharger  ac adapter  serial cable  4mb memory stick  and software  but a soft leather case  a pcmcia card  for laptop  a 16mb memory stick and another 4mb memory stick  which came with the pcmcia card the retail price for the camera has dropped since my purchase but my advice is to go to the electronics store to use and look at the camera  then find the best deal by shopping online and looking at auctions and stores that don t require you to pay tax  buying from a local store is still the best option for people that want to get it immediately and like having the option to return or exchange it easily b conclusion  some newer models have come on the market in the u s  since i got the f55  just from visiting the sony web site  i see that they now have the dsc s30  dsc s50  dsc s70  and dsc f505 which address the usb support  tiff file format  and zoom options  the f55 is a great digital camera and i recommend it only because i ve been happy with the results but i will probably upgrade to a newer model in the future because they are available here is a gallery of photos i ve taken with the f55 http www zing com album id 4294236267 user reviews of f55 at dcresource com http www dcresource com reviews

up photographs of objects and the micro option on the camera lets me do that without having to switch to  micro lens the only draw back is that it is easy to blur the image because of movement and hard to tell it is blurred from the led display it also has  short field of focus so sometimes other things closer or further away from the camera will be out of focus  wives lens the lens rotated back degrees and it  advertised as  way to take  picture or video of yourself while looking at the led but seriously this flexibility is one of the best features of the camera  use it to take pictures behind me of the sky or sunset when  am in  car and  am not driving of course if we are going the opposite direction or  am on the other side of the car  can stick it out the window and rotate the lens so  see the view in the led the lens on the newer  model wives too but it seems not on the duc six series  what could be improved   lack of optical room there isn  an optical room only  digital room on this camera this has been acceptable for the most part because  don  find the need to room in very often it  only when like   trying to photograph animals that  wish there was  room  would look into the other cybershot models if you need room option  picturegear like software the picturegear software that comes with the camera is the like version it  pretty weak and the software basically only lets the user download the images from the camera using the aerial connection use  photo editing software like photo deluge or photoshop if you want to manipulate the images if you own  sonya vain you may have the complete picturegear version which has more option and supposedly lets you stitch together images to create  panorama  aerial connection slow lack of us support using the aerial connection to download photo from the camera to the computer takes  very long time what  worse is that  can  really do anything else on the computer when it is downloading on top of that the picturegear software sometimes clashes  ve given up using the aerial method since  got  acacia card the card lets me access the memory stick on  lawton as if it was  regular drive then  hook up the lawton and my desktop computer on  network to get the files there is  memory stick floppy adapted but  haven  tried it neither the acacia card nor the floppy adapted come with the camera the  does not have us support but the newer models do some of the new sonya various have  memory stick slot on the side and that  one of the reasons  got  vain for my mon when we ve gone on trips  only need to take the camera and lawton after shooting  day  worth of pictures  move the files off of the camera to lawton  lack of non compressed file format the camera only stores still images as pegs and does not have the option to save in  non compressed format such as stiff there are two option for the quality of the image standard and fine  always use the fine setting because  usually end up further processing the image through photo editing software like photoshop and the final picture has to go through peg compression on top of the peg compression from the camera so  have to get the image from the camera in the best quality format possible  flash too strong the camera doesn  offer the usual flash option like fill red eye etc it basically has  high normal and low setting which  think are all too strong and tends to wash out the image in low light situations  normally turn off the use of the flash because  find the exposure comes out better but  have to be careful and hold the camera still or the picture blurs  have read about putting  piece of paper over the flash but  haven  tried that yet also some have reported red eye problems with the flash  supplied mb memory stick too small  can store about stills at the highest quality and resolution and only about video at  when   traveling  am able to get by with  mb memory stick for the whole day and evening storing about pictures and some video occasionally  run out of room and start using the mb memory stick  start up and recording time  don  know how well the  compares to other digital camera in terms of speed but there is  couple seconds delay when it starts up after  turn it on and when it records images and moves basically all digital camera  ve used have been like this and it gets annoying when timing is critical when you try the camera out in the store keep this in mind  lack of focus aperture film speed settings the only option available are white balance indoor outdoor and exposure  purchasing when  purchased this camera it was about retail and  got it at cry  for plus  mb memory stick for about  returned the camera  week later because  found  sonya employee in the area selling his camera for on bay  not only got the camera plus the accessories it normally comes with battery recharger ac adapted aerial cable mb memory stick and software but  soft leather case  acacia card for lawton  mb memory stick and another mb memory stick which came with the acacia card the retail price for the camera has dropped since my purchase but my advice is to go to the electronics store to use and look at the camera then find the best deal by shopping online and looking at auctions and stores that don  require you to pay tax buying from  local store is still the best option for people that want to get it immediately and like having the option to return or exchange it easily  conclusion some newer models have come on the market in the   since  got the  just from visiting the sonya web site  see that they now have the duc  duc  duc  and duc  which address the us support stiff file format and room option the  is  great digital camera and  recommend it only because  ve been happy with the results but  will probably upgrade to  newer model in the future because they are available here is  gallery of photo  ve taken with the  http www king com album id user reviews of  at resource com

49;camera; even though i see a few others have already written excellent reviews of this camera  i m still excited about purchasing mine   and thought i d chime in after doing a considerable bit of price feature comparisons for a digital camera in the  200 and under category  i ended up with the kodak cx4300  walmart sells them for  179 95  only  30 more than the price of the comparable 2 1 megapixel version for the money  i think this camera covers all the important bases  you get an lcd screen to preview your photos  which you re not going to have on the sub  100 dig  cameras as a rule  a glass lens instead of a lower quality plastic one  a built in flash with red eye reduction  a key feature  imo  plus ability to use only  fill flash   also key  a timer  so you can get into your own photos  the best resolution in its class  at 3mp  and backed by a company that s been doing cameras and film for a long time compared to some other digital cameras i ve used  including a  700 or so sony mavica  i think this kodak does an impressive job of properly capturing colors and handling indoor lighting   on the mavica i used  i often had problems with indoor photos coming out too dark  and requiring some touch up in photoshop before they looked really good  as for colors  the cheaper digital cameras often don t capture darker shades of red burgandy maroon properly  i had no such issue with this kodak on the downside though  the camera does have a few small flaws and faults  my lens cap fits fine  unlike one reviewers  apparently  but i m not really thrilled that it has one in the first place  their cheaper 2 1mp camera has a built in lens cover that shutters over the lens whenever you switch off the power  i d prefer that so there s one less thing to lose or break  i also ran into the problem of the directional toggle button accidently thinking i pushed a direction when i was trying to push down the middle of it to confirm a menu choice  some sort of true optical zoom would have been nice  too  i think i would have paid an extra  20 25 for that  if it was available i also agree with the reviewer who complained that at  70  the optional  easyshare dock  is a marketing ploy  how hard is to push a usb cable into the side of the camera and have your pc auto detect it and start transferring photos  the camera simply doesn t  need  a dock to make this operation easier  the charger built in the dock is great  but it should have come with the camera  ; even though  see  few others have already written excellent reviews of this camera   still excited about purchasing mine and thought   chime in after doing  considerable bit of price feature comparisons for  digital camera in the and under category  ended up with the today c palmar cells them for only more than the price of the comparable megapixel version for the money  think this camera covers all the important bases you get an led screen to review your photo which you re not going to have on the sub dig camera as  rule  glass lens instead of  lower quality plastic one  built in flash with red eye reduction  key feature mio plus ability to use only fill flash also key  time so you can get into your own photo the best resolution in its class at up and backed by  company that  been doing camera and film for  long time compared to some other digital camera  ve used including  or so sonya mavra  think this today does an impressive job of properly capturing colors and handling indoor lighting on the mavra  used  often had problems with indoor photo coming out too dark and requiring some touch up in photoshop before they looked really good as for colors the cheaper digital camera often don  capture darker shades of red burgundy maroon properly  had no such issue with this today on the downside though the camera does have  few small flaws and faults my lens cap fits fine unlike one reviews apparently but   not really thrilled that it has one in the first place their cheaper up camera has  built in lens cover that shutters over the lens whenever you switch off the power   prefer that so there  one less thing to lose or break  also ran into the problem of the direction tongue button accidently thinking  pushed  direction when  was trying to push down the middle of it to confirm  menu choice some sort of true optical room would have been nice too  think  would have paid an extra for that if it was available  also agree with the reviewed who complained that at the optional easyshare dock is  marketing play how hard is to push  us cable into the side of the camera and have your pp auto detect it and start transferring photo the camera simply doesn  need  dock to make this operation easier the charge built in the dock is great but it should have come with the camera

56;auto; the volvo xc90 has  like all volvos  a truly horrible name  it baffles me that people as nice as the swedes  150 forward looking  neutral  sauna inhabiting  high living socialists that they are  150 couldn 146t come up with something more friendly than xc90  i know that it 146s probably code for enormous volvo suv that looks like a great big car  rather than a box on wheels  and goes like stink but i don 146t like it  it 146s just not blonde enough  volvos should be called things like sven or agneta  but enough of my inane rambling and into the review proper the volvo xc90 is of course about as swedish as bruce springstein  conceived in america for america roads  american wallets and american sensibilities it is in fact a posh ford  no doubt the swedes were conned into selling to the blue oval  a misunderstanding involving a cell phone with poor reception  a fjord 2 hrs outside of stockholm and a half gallon of inexplicably expensive vodka  but sold they were and since then the pressure has been on to produce an suv of course the suv should have been a volvo concept  forever the masters of the utilitarian over the sexy  the safe over the breath taking and the roomy  remember those huge wagons  over the sensible  how many people really shifted furniture that often  volvo should have cleaned up in what the uk calls the  145grass  145n 146 gravel 146 market  150 allowing its owners to scamper across verges and up long driveways with not a whimper of complaint  alas the volvo bank account resembled that of mike tyson and so the never got around to developing the car that could define them  until ford came along  dipped deeper into debt and provided a much needed injection of cash a totally free hand of course was not granted  150 volvo is now as much a part of the re engineered platform world as any manufacturer and thus the xc90 sits on a platform developed for the s80  volvo imaginatively called this platform the e2  150 oh to be in their  145namestorms 146  huh  what this does is give the xc90 very car like proportions  or at least it looks as though it has car like proportions  it is in fact much bigger than it looks  much  much bigger  imagine bumping in to garly coleman and realizing that he could have a shot at the nba  a shock  right  not as much of a shock as the volvo 146s proportions  whilst it shares length and width with the s80 it 146s a full 14 inches taller  a riot of headroom  of course what those extra inches give is the appearance of ground clearance and that high driving position that invokes in us all a feeling of imperiousness so let 146s start by walking around the car  it looks like  well  it looks like a great big volvo  it 146s very slabby  very angular and has that swedish aversion to curves that has been the marque 146s signature  from the rear the tail lights absolutely dominate  erupting into huge pillars that seem to make up the entire rear pillars and threaten a vegas like explosion of light should you set foot on break  there 146s lots of matt black plastic as  145skirting 146  150 no doubt in a bid to establish  145off road credentials 146  150 clean they look a little tacky  but get some mud splashes going and they seem to blend in to the overall design well  the rear spilts 70 30 but seems a little high  necessitating a bend of the knees as you load up the groceries inside things are a step up from the usual volvo blandness  there 146s lots of light colors  adding to airiness  there 146s wood that looks like wood and fake aluminum that looks like  erm  fake aluminum  the overall effect is pleasing and the car feels built to last  dash layout is simple to the point of insulting but again feels very volvo with only four things  speed  distance  temperature and fuel level  outlined  i found the driving position to be excellent if a little bus like  my wife had more problems  saying that the high wheel and upright position made her feel like a kid behind the wheel of her dad 146s car  she 146s 5 146 4 148  i think  she also had problems with the thick pillars restricting vision  something i 146ve read about but didn 146t experience myself  seats are great as you 146d expect  with the leather adding a real volvo smell to the mix  lumbar support is adjustable and excellent as is the whiplash control  there are lots of seats too  three rows of them doing all manner of clever tricks  folding in numerous ways and demanding a degree in applied algebra to quantify their cleverness  you can even make one row disappear entirely  the back row is less than roomy  not ideal for small kids  too far away to reach  and therefore designed exclusively  as far as i can tell  for those annoying 8 10 year olds who want to play  145rip the arms off expensive future collectables 146  still the lay out is fine and dandy and everything feels too well made for a car that is ultimately going to be trashed by the carrying of kids  dogs and elderly relative 146s furniture start her up and things get even sweeter  volvo may be know for its 5 cyl engines but the 2 9l 6 cyl engine is just as sweet  280lbs of torque below 2 000 rpm is good for initial shunt  or pulling that trailer  and with 268 bhp there 146s plenty of power too  the automatic gearbox does a good job of keeping forward momentum  150 yes there 146s a little turbo lag and you 146re not going to lose many people from he lights but the car pulls and keeps pulling all the way to the redline all wheels are driven  giving safe but unremarkable response  you know what the volvo is going to do  150 it 146s safe  it 146s unremarkable  not overly involving  150 very swedish  quite detached and a little cold perhaps but responsive  the car is a pretty relaxing place to be  150 you waft along  a little too upright but feeling quite unnoticed at speeds slightly faster than you 146d imagine  we didn 146t take the car off road but have heard that it copes okay and that 146s good enough  150 you don 146t buy something this plutocratic to get it dirty down on the farm head quickly into a corner and you 146re going to feel your lunch rising in your throat  150 this isn 146t a taut car by any measure but one  150 that measure being other suvs and against those it more than holds its own safety of course is a volvo advantage  though renault beat them  and this car is no exception  here are some of the unique safety features  taken from the website  assume that every other safety feature is included  150 you 146ll be right 149 roll stability control  ft  gyrosocopic sensoring  it won 146t roll over then 149 full length  145curtain 146 airbags  protecting every seat 149 all seat seatbelt pre tensioners 149 lower cross members  150 saving you from  145mounting 146 other cars in case of accident 149 pedestrian crumple zones  150 saving people when you mow them down 149 whiplash protection  150 the front seats move back in case of impact  saving you whiplash pretty safe then the volvo is swedish in the way it 146s equipeed however  150 this car is stacked like a pneumatic blonde  150 with front and rear controls for the climate control  electric driver 146s seat  cruise  nice leather  real wood and a cd player good enough to have in your study so what did we think about the volvo  well like roxette  another fine swedish export  it was well put together  very professional and perhaps a little too polished  i like to drive   to feel a car moving fluidly with me and the volvo didn 146t really allow me to do that  150 wallowing through bends when pushed and quietly letting you know that this kind of behavior really isn 146t on and the looks are a bit of a turn off too  it looks exactly as you 146d expect and american volvo to look  150 supersized  alas it 146s a look that just doesn 146t come off of course the volvo wasn 146t made for me  it was made for people with children  and dogs  and all the stuff that comes with children and dogs  it was designed to deal with the baggage  physical and emotional  the desperate need for safety above all and the even more desperate need for a little space that having kids brings  that and to look suitably expensive  not to mention expansive  on the lawn  with that in mind this car is a complete success now where did i put those condoms  ; the vulvo c has like all vols  truly horrible name it baffled me that people as nice as the swedes forward looking neutral anna inhibiting high living socialists that they are couldn  come up with something more friendly than c  know that it  probably code for enormous vulvo sun that looks like  great big car rather than  box on wheels and goes like stink but  don  like it it  just not blonde enough vols should be called things like even or agents but enough of my insane rambling and into the review proper the vulvo c is of course about as swedish as bruce springstein conceived in america for america roads american wallet and american sensibilities it is in fact  post ford no doubt the swedes were donned into selling to the blue oval  misunderstanding involving  cell phone with poor reception  ford his outside of stockholm and  half gallon of inexplicable expensive vodka but sold they were and since then the pressure has been on to produce an sun of course the sun should have been  vulvo concept forever the masters of the utilitarian over the sex the safe over the breath taking and the room remember those huge wagons over the sensible how many people really shifted furniture that often vulvo should have cleaned up in what the up calls the grass  gravel market allowing its owners to stamped across verses and up long driveways with not  whisper of complaint alas the vulvo bank account resembled that of mike son and so the never got around to developing the car that could define them until ford came along dipped deeper into debt and provided  much needed injection of cash  totally free hand of course was not granted vulvo is now as much  part of the re engineered platform world as any manufacturer and thus the c sits on  platform developed for the  vulvo imaginative called this platform the  oh to be in their namestorms hut what this does is give the c very car like proportions or at least it looks as though it has car like proportions it is in fact much bigger than it looks much much bigger imagine bumping in to early column and realizing that he could have  shot at the na  shock right not as much of  shock as the vulvo  proportions whilst it shares length and width with the  it   full inches

58;camera;   background   i do not own this camera  but a friend of mine got it for christmas and i spent some time playing with it  and here are my thoughts on it b  camera asthetics   the camera itself looks pretty cool  it s small size allows it to be placed easily into most pants coat pockets one of the things i noticed right off the bat was  in place of a manual lens cover  there is an automatic protective barrier instead which opens and closes when you turn the camera on or off  that is pretty handy to me  because on my olympus c4040  which is a larger camera  the lens cap tends to be somewhat of a pain if it s windy outside and you re trying to take pictures  it blows around and may even hit the camera as the cap dangles from its cord speaking of power on  that is something i don t like about the sony  you have to turn  power on  and then select your shooting mode  on the olympus you simply turn the dial and it comes on  ready to go  no extra step the 1 5  lcd has a surprisingly high resolution  when reviewing pictures  i was amazed at how clear and crisp the images were menu navigation was fairly intuitive  but since i didn t have the manual  some of the symbols were a little cryptic and i couldn t figure out what they were  if you ve had previous experience with digital cameras or photography  you shouldn t have any problems with this camera    picture quality   the various image resolutions to choose from are shown below for the included 32 mb memory stick memory fine standard 2592x1944  5mp  12 23 2592x1728  3 2  12 23 2048x1536  3mp  20 37 1280x960  1mp  50 93 640x480  vga  196 491 the images we were shooting with the camera were mostly at the 2048x1536 standard resolution at 3mp  the color detail at this level was very impressive  we were inside a restaurant with other friends at the time  and all the pictures came out looking amazing  were they as good as ones shot with my 4mp olympus  i don t know  but if i had to guess  the color detail was better with the sony than i would have gotten shooting with my camera some mpg vx video was shot  and wow i was really impressed with the quality of video taken in the low light restaurant situation  it wasn t grainy at all  and the frame rate and audio sync were excellent  i think the file end up being almost 7mb for about 20 seconds i wouldn t suggest using the camera as a camcorder though  but it is good to know that it does have this ability should the need ever arise b  things to consider   batteries this particular sony model uses a proprietary sony battery  model np fc11  i personally find this as somewhat of a big negative on the camera  from a casual user standpoint  for the following reasons 1  to buy an additional rechargeable battery is  49 95  everyone needs at least one additional  if not two additional batteries  if you travel and are out away from your hotel room or ship room  and your battery dies during your excursion down in the kileua caldera on the big island of hawaii  then what are you going to do  you see my point  you should always carry multiple batteries 2  along the obvious same lines as  1  it doesn t use standard aa batteries which can be bought from just about anywhere at anytime true story example  last year i was at a professional women s billiards tournament in tunica  ms  a lot of famous people were there  and i was taking pictures like there was no tomorrow  both of the famous people  and me with the famous people  towards the end of the day  i had completely exhausted my original set and backup set of batteries  but there was still more to do  so  being about 30 minutes from our hotel room  i just went to the hotel store and picked up a pack of aa batteries  popped  em in and shot the rest of the night if i would have had a cam that used special batteries  i would have been screwed  so that s my main hang up on batteries and digital cameras get a card reader i highly recommend getting the card reader accessory from sandisk  it s cheap  20  and allows for some major convenience when transferring pics to your computer  if you use windows xp  it s a plug and play device  i borrowed my friends  came in  hooked it up to the usb port on my puter and transferred the files off the memory stick with no problems  the computer treats the memory reader as a separate disk drive  kewl carrying case   that s up to you  i don t have one  but my friend bought one for the sony  i personally think  in most situations they can be more trouble than they are worth  especially if you are travelling  but it depends on your travel situation extended warranties   these days technology advances at such a rapid pace  in 12 months  the camera will only be worth a fraction of what you paid for it  it is for this reason  i do not recommend the purcahse of extended warranties on electronic items  by the time the standard warranty has expired  99 times out of 100 you re better of junking it  and buying something new and better  many times for less than what paid for what you re throwing away b  conclusion   the camera is pretty expensive  retailing for  450  so it may be out of some people s price range  however  it s small size and high quality images make it a pretty good contender if those things are important to you  ; background  do not own this camera but  friend of mine got it for

60;camera; being only the second digital camera i have ever used  i m going to say that hp315 is a pretty nice little camera  it is best made for whoever wants to take some nice quality pictures and is willing to take a step forward with the technology  it is relatively small  smaller than the slr models and is not heavy at all  the photo quality is great  much better other similar cameras  that are in the same price range it has 2 1 megapixels and you can choose if you want to shoot in regular  fine  or superfine mode  naturally  superfine requires more memory on the 8 mb card  only allowing you to take a total of 10 superfine photos before you download them onto your computer  in regular mode you can take up to 50  there is a 1 8 inch color screen on the back of the camera  allowing you to view and select photos for deletion or downloading  to take pictures you can either just look through the viewfinder or turn on the lcd and look through that  using the lcd does however drain the battery rather quickly  so i try to avoid it unless i want to view already taken pictures  the hp315 does have a 2 5 digital zoom  however  to take pictures using the zoom is a bit difficult  you have to turn on the lcd to do this  draining battery  however  it does help to produce beautiful shots  overall  i would say that this is a great little camera  it has a nice weight  is easy to operate and has handy little rubber grips on it so that you don t drop it  if you have the money  you should look into it br br  ; being only the second digital camera  have ever used   going to say that he is  pretty nice little camera it is best made for whoever wants to take some nice quality pictures and is willing to take  step forward with the technology it is relatively small smaller than the sir models and is not heavy at all the photo quality is great much better other similar camera that are in the same price range it has megapixels and you can choose if you want to shoot in regular fine or supervise mode naturally supervise requires more memory on the mb card only allowing you to take  total of supervise photo before you download them onto your computer in regular mode you can take up to there is  inch color screen on the back of the camera allowing you to view and select photo for deletions or downloading to take pictures you can either just look through the viewfinder or turn on the led and look through that using the led does however drain the battery rather quickly so  try to avoid it unless  want to view already taken pictures the he does have  digital room however to take pictures using the room is  bit difficult you have to turn on the led to do this draining battery however it does help to produce beautiful shots overall  would say that this is  great little camera it has  nice weight is easy to operate and has handy little rubber grip on it so that you don  drop it if you have the money you should look into it br br

64;camera; i ve always thought that digital cameras were one of the most important  147killer apps 148 of the technological age  but it has taken until now for the technology to advance enough and produce a product that has the quality and features to truly replace your typical 35mm point and shoot camera  the d510 zoom from olympus is a perfect example of such a product now i ll be honest  i didn t do a whole lot of research before buying my new toy  i knew enough about digital cameras to recognize the features that set them apart  but i had not done any specific research on this camera  but being the gear head i am  when i discovered this gem at a severely reduced clearance price i snatched it up  i knew at that time that olympus made some very nice cameras in both traditional and digital formats  my impulses on this one seemed to be right on  i have been using the camera for several weeks now  and am incredibly impressed with the convenience a quality digital camera can provide  the camera is a 2 1 mega pixels  this is basically all the quality you need for almost any application  pictures for the web turn out great  printed pictures in 4x6 and 5x7 look amazing  you can even stretch it to 8x10 without much of a major impact  1600 x 1200 pictures are produced by most settings  but you can cut down the size to increase the room for pictures  the 3x optical and 9x digital is something that is fairly hard to find in a camera in this price range  if your in the camera business  you know that olympus makes great quality lens  you ll know the a better quality lens will create a better picture  these hold true with the d510  if you do not know the difference between optical and digital zoom  optical is the physical adjustment of the lens to get a closer picture  digital simply takes the picture then crops and resizes it to the desired zoom  this is only useful if you want a bigger picture and in most cases  the quality is decreased  3x optical is more then enough for my use  the digital zoom is nice to have but i don t use it much because i can crop if necessary using software on my pc  a beautiful feature olympus includes is the ability to toggle the use of digital zoom  the zoom button is simply a rocker switch located next to the shutter button  if your using the lcd screen as a view finder  you will notice it will display a visual guide showing how much zoom is currently being applied  this guide also shows when you are making use of digital zoom or just optical zoom  another small feature  but it illustrates the thought that was put into this design the camera has a host of other features that set it apart from others  usb auto connect gives you an amazing amount of flexibility and allows windows to recognize the camera as an external hard drive and lets your simply drag and drop the files you want  when you combine this with windows xp s digital camera wizard  you couldn t ask for anything easier  this also allows you to use this camera as a card reader for any of your smart media cards  speaking of smart media cards  the camera includes a 8mb card in box  which allows for just fewer than 20 high quality shots  turn down the quality slightly and get in upwards of 50 the ability to plug your camera into a video input on a tv is a great addition to the already complete feature set  when your on a trip and don t have the ability to get a hold of a computer for a few minutes to view your pictures  simply plug in the standard rca output cable and connect it to any tv  an instant slideshow  olympus was nice enough to include this cable in the package  kudos to you olympus the quicktime movie capture feature allows you to take short movie clips  25 seconds long  the length of time and lack of audio capture makes this almost pointless  but i have found that i have used it for recording lab results in various classes at school the d 510 looks great on paper  but how does it perform in the real world opening the box gives displays various documents including your user manual and software  it has two cables  usb and video out  a set of nimh batteries  a 8mb card  a wristband and the camera itself  everything you need to get going is there  although the inclusion of an ac adapter would have been appreciated the actual camera is somewhat bulky compared to smaller models offered by hp  canon  and fuji  the newer d520 shares similar specifications but is almost half the depth of the d510 and does not retain the solid of the d510  the d510 case feels similar to brushed aluminium giving it a professional feel and style  it still fits into a pocket  on my rather large pants  but is better suited to remain in a case in a purse or backpack the pictures that come out of the camera are bright and vivid and i 146ve printed many in a variety of sizes  one of my pictures recently won 2nd place in a photo contest  picture  land of the living sky available at www barndoorfanclub org gallery twilight twilight html  the variety of shutter speed and aperture settings can be useful for someone with more experience in working with traditional slrs but i find that letting the camera automatically choose proper settings tends to produce excellent pictures  having said that  most of my low light pictures turned out less than impressive unless i played with the settings myself  the user manual includes a great guide on how to take the best pictures in a variety of situations and is worth reading through the software is not very useful  although it does allow you to take a number of shots and digitally  147stitch 148 them together to make a panorama  the results of the stitching function look very professional  i do most of my picture touch ups with jasc paint shop pro  i purchased two things with my camera  a 16mb smart media card and a small camera case  the 16mb allows me to capture 30 high quality pictures and then the 8mb can be used as a backup  the case protects the camera wherever i go and holds the usb cable and the extra memory card  nimh rechargeable batteries are on my list of things to pick up  as with most digital cameras  the d510 eats batteries  it is best to keep an extra set with the case as well  the battery life indicator only shows when the batteries are just about to die and will otherwise show a full charge until it 146s too late reasons to buy    powerful camera  2 1 mp  3x optical 9x digital  these features alone make it a desirable and very functional camera to have  low cost  the price point i 146ve seen for this camera makes it a viable option for a christmas present or just as a straight replacement for a 35mm for those new to digital cameras  impressive picture results  photos are bright and colourful  perfect for printing with a photo printer or getting professionally printed  it 146s just fun to use  the ability to take a picture of something at a get together  show it on a slideshow later that night  print out a copy for everyone there and then have it posted on a website the next day makes it fun to use things to watch out for  no camera case  best to pick one of these guys up  a good one can be had for under  20   software is weak  besides the ability to stitch panorama  the software was relatively weak and only useful as a photo viewer  something that windows xp does natively quite well  menu system  like other reviews  the menus do require some getting used to and i frequently have to refer back to the manual to track down specific features  some effort could be made to craft a less intimidating system conclusion the olympus d510 is a solid performer right of the box  with 2 1 mp and 3x optical zoom  it is the perfect replacement for a traditional 35mm or slr user experimenting with the new digital camera technology  although i do have some complaints about what is included camera and what isn 146t  they are relatively insignificant compared to the quality and usefulness of the camera overall  out of all the cameras i have tried out before and after the purchase of my d510  i am still impressed with the quality it produces  for the price  the d510 is best of class update i left my digital camera in my glove box by accident and over the course of two days was involved in some amateur rally racing  unfortunately i had not left the camera in its case and some of the pixels on the lcd preview screen have gone out  i have not go a hold of olympus yet but will publish my experiences with technical support as soon as i finalize what is going on  ;  ve always thought that digital camera were

will display  visual guide showing how much room is currently being applied this guide also shows when you are making use of digital room or just optical room another small feature but it illustrates the thought that was put into this design the camera has  host of other features that set it apart from others us auto connect gives you an amazing amount of flexibility and allows windows to recognize the camera as an external hard drive and lets your simply drag and drop the files you want when you combine this with windows up  digital camera wizard you couldn  ask for anything easier this also allows you to use this camera as  card reader for any of your smart media cards speaking of smart media cards the camera includes  mb card in box which allows for just fewer than high quality shots turn down the quality slightly and get in upwards of the ability to plug your camera into  video input on  to is  great addition to the already complete feature set when your on  trip and don  have the ability to get  hold of  computer for  few minutes to view your pictures simply plug in the standard sca output cable and connect it to any to an instant slideshow polypus was nice enough to include this cable in the package buds to you polypus the quicktime movie capture feature allows you to take short movie clips seconds long the length of time and lack of audit capture makes this almost painless but  have found that  have used it for recording lab results in various classes at school the  looks great on paper but how does it perform in the real world opening the box gives displays various documents including your user manual and software it has two tables us and video out  set of nigh batteries  mb card  wristband and the camera itself everything you need to get going is there although the inclusion of an ac adapted would have been appreciated the actual camera is somewhat bulky compared to smaller models offered by he canon and full the newer  shares similar specification but is almost half the depth of the  and does not retain the solid of the  the  case feels similar to brushed aluminium giving it  professional feel and style it still fits into  pocket on my rather large parts but is better suited to remain in  case in  purse or backpack the pictures that come out of the camera are bright and vivid and  ve printed many in  variety of sizes one of my pictures recently won nd place in  photo contest picture land of the living sky available at www barndoorfanclub org gallery twilight twilight html the variety of shutter speed and aperture settings can be useful for someone with more experience in working with traditional sir but  find that letting the camera automatically choose proper settings tends to produce excellent pictures having said that most of my low light pictures turned out less than impressive unless  played with the settings myself the user manual includes  great guide on how to take the best pictures in  variety of situations and is worth reading through the software is not very useful although it does allow you to take  number of shots and digital stitch them together to make  panorama the results of the stitching function look very professional  do most of my picture touch up with was paint shop pro  purchased two things with my camera  mb smart media card and  small camera case the mb allows me to capture high quality pictures and then the mb can be used as  back the case protects the camera wherever  go and holds the us cable and the extra memory card nigh rechargeable batteries are on my list of things to pick up as with most digital camera the  eats batteries it is best to keep an extra set with the case as well the battery life indicator only shows when the batteries are just about to die and will otherwise show  full charge until it  too late reasons to buy powerful camera up  optical  digital these features alone make it  desirable and very functional camera to have low cost the price point  ve seen for this camera makes it  viable option for  christmas present or just as  straight replacement for  mm for those new to digital camera impressive picture results photo are bright and colourful perfect for printing with  photo printer or getting professionally printed it  just fun to use the ability to take  picture of something at  get together show it on  slideshow later that night print out  copy for everyone there and then have it posted on  webster the next day makes it fun to use things to watch out for no camera case best to pick one of these guns up  good one can be had for under software is weak besides the ability to stitch panorama the software was relatively weak and only useful as  photo viewer something that windows up does naively quite well menu system like other reviews the venus do require some getting used to and  frequently have to refer back to the manual to track down specific features some effort could be made to craft  less intimidating system conclusion the polypus  is  solid performer right of the box with up and  optical room it is the perfect replacement for  traditional mm or sir user experimenting with the new digital camera technology although  do have some complaints about what is included camera and what isn  they are relatively insignificant compared to the quality and usefulness of the camera overall out of all the camera  have tried out before and after the purchase of my   am still impressed with the quality it produces for the price the  is best of class update  left my digital camera in my glove box by accident and over the course of two days was involved in some amateur rally racing unfortunately  had not left the camera in its case and some of the pipes on the led review screen have gone out  have not go  hold of polypus yet but will publish my experiences with technical support as soon as  finalize what is going on 
65;camera; let s begin with what comes out of the box the 4mp kodak ls443 camera with built in 16mb memory a docking station a battery ac adapter usb cable let me begin by saying  thanks kodak for not making us spend 100 extra dollars on things like the ac adapter and batteries which should be included in the first place this is my opinion on the camera  i love it for it s picture quality but i dislike it for not making me feel so great about myself when i take a picture  what does this mean well  when you see most cameras  the lcd is so crisp you can see if you goofed up the picture when you took it  therefore  you can quickly erase it and take another snapshot  with the ls443  you take a picture and the display on the screen isn t always all that great so you can t tell if it will be blurry or if there is too much light  keep this in mind when purchasing the camera  luckily  the picture quality is so top notch with this camera  i was able to foresee the lack of lcd display as far as the lens is concerned  it is a high end propriety schneider kreuznach variogon lens  there is a 3x optical zoom and 3 3x digital zoom for a total 10x zoom  in case you don t know how the zooms work  this is the difference optical zoom is a lens change causing a picture to be snapshotted as if you were physically closer to the object you are capturing  this means that the picture is as good quality as it would be if you were physically near the camera itself digital zoom is a hardware software approach to  zooming  in on a particular object at a certain distance  this type of zoom causes pixelation and destroys the overall quality of the picture  i don t even bother using digital zoom  i have it turned off  if you are looking to get a camera with great quality and zoom  only look at optical zoom  not digital  if you do look at digital  make sure that the camera is of high megapixels because you will need them when digitally zooming in the autofocus on the camera is great  you hold the button down half way and a little green box on the camera s lcd turns red  this means that the camera is focused and you can depress the button all the way to snapshot the picture  immediately after that the image is displayed on the screen and you are ready for your next shot fortunately  kodak took a huge step is combining the picture mode with the review mode  this means that you can hit the review button at any time in picture mode and it will show you all the pictures stored on the memory card  this helps a lot so you don t have to physically turn the camera into a different mode every time you want to review a picture  there is also an independent delete and share button available  that way you can immediately delete a picture if you don t like it  or you can hit the share button  which will allow you flag the picture to be emailed to a previously set list  via computer software  of possible recipients  as soon as you dock the camera  it will prompt you to email out the pictures you have flagged as far as the modes are concerned on the camera  it contains the following movie mode   this is with sound and it also plays back sound  the quality is not so great but you can t expect much from a digital camera  also  you don t have the ability to zoom in and out during recording since it will make noise and be captured auto mode  this mode is great for everyday pictures of people  objects at a reasonable distance  it takes the best picture dependent on the current situation  the autofocus is performed by an independent blue light which shines prior to the snapshot and focuses the camera sport mode  this is ideal for objects in motion and will increase the shutter speed thus trying to avoid blurriness macro mode  this is for objects that are closer than 28cm  flash is automatically disabled and this option works great  i ve used it many times  night time mode  this is great for night time when light is readily available  the shutter speed is decreased and hence more light is absorbed  however  this means that even a slight shake in your hand will output a blurry image  thus you need some sort of tripod when taking these types of pictures landscape mode  this sets the lens to infinite focus  there is no redbox greenbox to indicate focus  this mode works fantastic and i ve used it many times to take great pictures of scenery as far as the options are concerned on the camera itself  you have the ability to set it to multiple mode which will take up to 3 shots in a row  works great for objects in motion  you also have the ability to change the flash type to automatic  always on  red eye reduction or off  red eye reduction is a little weird since it flashes twice instead of flickering first and then flashing  this means your guests will assume that the picture was taken on the first flash and start to move right at the time the actual picture is taken  be careful of this and warn them ahead of time the pictures can be taken in color  black and white  or sephia  the olden days look there is control to increase or decrease white exposure  for snowy days or days there is too much or too little light there is the ability to set the quality of the picture  you can make it the full 4 megapixels  2 2 megapixels or  1 megapixel  with a 128mb card  you can take 103 pictures at best quality as far as the cards are concerned  this camera uses a secure digital   multimedia card  these are generally much more expensive than compact flash or smart media  however  it has 16mb of internal memory which is used once the card is filled  the camera comes with a docking station  when you place the camera on the docking station  it begins to charge and immediately allows you to transfer over pictures to your computer  charging time is about 2 hours which is much better than the sony dsc p71 which requires 13 hours  an excellent feature of the camera is that you can physically connect the same ac adapter and same usb that goes into the docking station  right into the side of the camera  this means you can transfer pics to any computer without carrying around the entire docking station  however  take note that the ac adapter  when plugged directly into the camera  will not charge it but will let you take infinite amount of pictures without a battery no matter where you  you will find the ac adapter costs much more and the battery charger is a standalone device  kodak simplifies our life by including all this in the package drawbacks of this camera also include the fact that there is no way to check the battery life unless it s dying in which a battery indicator comes on the lcd  usually you can take about 75 pictures with the lcd on and upto 300 pictures with the lcd off  be prepared to buy an extra battery  these batteries are proprietary and can only be bought in select places  luckily they are dirt cheap  you can get a battery additional wall charger great for travel  for about 25 dollars if you look around online  one other thing that i would love to have seen would have been an additional text lcd display which showed number of pics remaining  battery indicator and few other required options  this way you wouldn t have to have the lcd on most of the time  however  for the price  you can t expect to have everything i chose this camera because i wanted the quality of the pics to be great  not for just the features  what you are looking for is up to you  good luck with buying a digicam and i hope you are as satisfied as i was with my purchase  ; let  begin with what

72;camera; i have used 35mm cameras in the past and some other digital cameras and the kodak ls443 puts all those other ones to shame  once you start taking pictures then you will know what i m talking about  when you first download the pictures to your computer  you will be amazed at the picture quality and how vibrant the colors look  also the camera comes with the docking station that makes the transfer of pictures very fast and easy now for the review b  picture quality and memory   first off  the picture quality  the camera has three settings for picture quality  at the highest setting the pictures are very close to what a regular 35mm film camera would do  also at this setting you can get some great 4 by 6 or 8 by 10 prints  the specifications say you can get up to 20 by 30 prints but i have not tried those  i think the recommended size is up to 11 by 14  with those three sizes this camera is perfect for most users  the highest setting of the camera is 4 mega pixels  the second setting is 2 2 mega pixels and the last setting is 1 mega pixel  i mostly used the 4 mp setting when taking most of my pictures but i have used the 1 mp setting when i want to send emails to people  at the highest setting the pictures are about 1 megabyte in size so i would recommend buying a memory card of at least 128 mb  i personally bought a 256 mb card and with that i can take over 200 pictures at the highest quality setting and about nineteen minutes of video in movie mode  the difference in price between the 128 and the 256 mb card is not that much  the actual specifications on how many pictures you can take depending on the card size can be seen at the kodak site b  controls   in some reviews that i read some people have said that the shutter button is spongy and it is hard to control  this was not the case with me  to get the camera to take the best pictures possible  you would hold down the shutter button half way and then the camera would automatically set the focus and the flash settings  when it does that then you just press the shutter button all the way down to take the picture  some people said that it takes a long time to auto focus but this is not the case  the camera is ready to take the picture quite quickly the zoom is quite good  i just recommend that you don t use the digital aspect of it  only the optical  i took a few pictures using the digital zoom and the picture quality dropped off somewhat the camera operates in several modes  the only one that i haven t used yet is the night mode so i cannot comment on it but all the other modes do exactly what they say they can do  for example  my little nephew was running around  so i put the camera in sport mode and the pictures came out great  very focused with no blurring  this is another thing that other people have complained about and i don t see why  that is why the camera has all these different modes  so you can get the best pictures during different situations the camera also has a lot of manual controls for setting up the exposure  white balance  where to focus  iso and other things so there is a lot of stuff that novice picture takers can play around with  most of the time i have the camera set in automatic mode  but to get all the other features to work right you just have to experiment and take pictures in different conditions to see what works best  the manual guide of the camera explains each function pretty well so you can pick up all the features pretty quickly every time you switch to a new mode  there is a quick explanation of what it does so this makes the camera very easy to operate b  lcd   one of the cons of this camera is the lcd  first of all the picture quality in the lcd is not good at all  when i took a few pictures i thought they were all coming out bad when i viewed them using the review feature of the camera  the photos don t look clear and the colors look a bit off  that is a different case when you see the pictures on a computer  then you can really see what the camera can do  also  i was taking some pictures outdoors  and you can barely see the image on the lcd screen  also at night you can t see anything on the screen  it would have been nice if they would have added controls to the lcd screen to change the contrast or the brightness to adjust to these conditions  these drawbacks are not that bad and can be overlooked because of the picture quality of the camera  ;

81;camera; digital cameras are very much like computers by now  wait six months and you brand new camera will be topped and out featured by the new release  but much like my computer  i want something that works well  is dependable  and gives me what i need  in this case  i want an easy and convenient camera that takes good pictures  the olympus d 490 zoom is ideal because not only does it give me what i want  but it didn t cost a ridiculous amount as well first and foremost i should mention a couple of elements that are always talked about when addressing digital cameras and that i needed to keep in mind while shopping around  said elements are megapixels and storage megapixels  by now  digital cameras are coming out with 4  megapixel cameras for around  1000 dollars  i m sure in 5 years they ll be  300  just like 2 megapixel cameras went through not so long ago   megapixels  are essentially the number of pixels that make up your pictures  and the higher the number of megapixels  the more fine detailed your pictures are  1 megapixel cameras are the flashbulb wind up cameras of the 21st century to your average store clerk by now  and though i d like to think the 2 1 olympus d 490 zoom isn t yet  it probably will be in no time  but unless you re a forensics detective charged with analyzing evidence photos  the 2 1 megapixels crank out huge  gorgeous pictures that will suit any occasion  i ve seen higher quality cameras  results and yes  they are better  but only in the same way platinum is  better  than gold storage  there s different ways to save your pictures in memory to place on your computer  some take regular 3 5 inch floppy discs  sonys take their special memory sticks  and several take sandisk s smartmedia cards which are a little smaller than two postage stamps yet store a lot more than the floppy kind and are much more common than sony s specialized memory storage system  the d 490 zoom comes with an 8m card and you can purchase larger ones for a semi expensive price  but keep in mind  for this and all purchases concerning this camera  that if you count enough pictures  you will end up saving money if you consider all film and developing purchases you won t ever bother with again incidentally  for more information concerning both of these slightly tricky elements and several others you really should give thought to before buying a digital camera  seek more information on the  net  or what i did  which is study the large article in a semi recent consumer reports magazine that greatly helped me out as for the camera itself  i ve been very happy with it  it does crank out high quality pictures  you can use the typical view finder  which saves power  or the screen built into the back  it has a convenient flash with several options  anti red eye  long distance for darkened scenery  even  long distance anti red eye  i can scan all pictures as soon as i take them  take multiple shots if i think one hasn t come out well and delete any that didn t  and best of all can take countless stupid  innane  and goofy pictures that i normally would ve never  wasted film on  it has a nifty little zoom that can also be set to digital though to be frank i ve heard negative things about digital zoom so it s at the end of the list of things i ve yet to learn about the camera  and that leads me to one of the only drawbacks with so many options comes a rather complicated on screen menu  and it displays on menu while the camera s on and another when off which can be confusing  but my opinion is that you have to take the bad with the good  you could have less complex menus with a camera that has less functionality  while pointing out the negatives  the d 490 zoom does not include an ac adapter  nor does it have a usb connector  also  regular aa batteries aren t supposed to be used with it  there s a special kind designed for high end electronics which i didn t know until i had already purchased it  finally  the only way to turn off the camera is to close the sliding door but it s dangerously close to the telescoping lens which makes me wonder if they could have designed it a bit better  otherwise  i m completely out of  cons  but i m being purposefully critical finally  i am a big believer that this camera will pay for itself after i take enough pictures with it  i  splurged  on this purchase  buying the camera on sale but also buying special rechargable batteries made for digital cameras  the recharger  and a  flashpath  sandisk floppy disk adapter to make transferring the pictures from camera to computer infinitely easier   that s the next critique i ll crank out  all together it cost me around  650  i figure that after 1000 pictures the camera will have paid for itself  i ve only had it for less than two months  and it s already 1 5th of the way there considering everything  the olympus d 490 zoom is a great product  it s dependable  solidly built  offers loads of functions and fun to use  it

82;camera;   describe your experience using this product when i use this camera it is mainly to take pictures of my friends and special lifetime events that go on like going to parties or other fun functions  i use it completely in lieu of a normal 35 mm camera and it operates just as easily  i think its great because on the little screen in the back you can tell if you blinked in the picture  and if you did immediately retake the picture so you dont have to wait to get the film developed to find out that the picture was horrible because you blinked or put your head in a weird position and got a double chin etc  it is great for that purpose  when i try to take pictures of my dogs with it though  is where i found that it isnt so great they arent the most patient of subjects  they often will not hold the pose as long as a human so the picture is all a matter of luck    why did you buy this product i got the camera as a gift for graduating from college so i could document my travels after graduation  it is perfect for that  i took it with me everywhere and have great quality pictures from everywhere i went  it was lightweight and easy to carry around with me everywhere so i didnt worry about it at all  in fact  i had it in my small purse and didnt even remember most of the time because it was so lightweight    what do you love about this product obviously so far you can tell that i love the picture quality  and the lightweight and ease of use  the camera is great for amateur photography  or just documenting your life    what do you hate what i dont like about the camera is that i have had it for a short amount of time and have had to buy the batteries for it 4 times already  of course some were completely my fault like for leaving it plugged into my computer overnight so it drained the batteries keeping itself awake  or when it opened the slide front when i didnt have it in a bag in my purse so the camera was just sitting there waiting to take pictures but just the same it is irritating because the local radio shack doesnt carry the batteries in stock so i have to order them the other thing i dont like is the inability to zoom into things really far away  one night  i saw a picture of the moon that was absolutely amazing and wanted to take a picture of it to use as my background on my monitor  i took the picture and got it home only to realize that all i had was really sky  the moon was so tiny that you couldnt even tell it was really there  ; describe your experience using this product when  use this camera it is mainly to take pictures of my friends and special lifetime events that go on like going to parties or other fun functions  use it completely in lieu of  normal mm camera and it operate just as easily  think its great because on the little screen in the back you can tell if you blinked in the picture and if you did immediately retaken the picture so you dont have to wait to get the film developed to find out that the picture was horrible because you blinked or put your head in  weird position and got  double chin etc it is great for that purpose when  try to take pictures of my dogs with it though is where  found that it isn so great they agent the most patient of subjects they often will not hold the pose as long as  human so the picture is all  matter of luck why did you buy this product  got the camera as  gift for granulating from college so  could document my travels after granulation it is perfect for that  took it with me everywhere and have great quality pictures from everywhere  went it was lightweight and easy to carry around with me everywhere so  didn worry about it at all in fact  had it in my small purse and didn even remember most of the time because it was so lightweight what do you love about this product obviously so far you can tell that  love the picture quality and the lightweight and ease of use the camera is great for amateur photography or just documenting your life what do you hate what  dont like about the camera is that  have had it for  short amount of time and have had to buy the batteries for it times already of course some were completely my fault like for leaving it plugged into my computer overnight so it drained the batteries keeping itself awake or when it opened the slide front when  didn have it in  bag in my purse so the camera was just sitting there waiting to take pictures but just the same it is irritating because the local radio shock doesn carry the batteries in stock so  have to order them the other thing  dont like is the inability to room into things really far away one night  saw  picture of the moon that was absolutely amazing and wanted to take  picture of it to use as my background on my monitor  took the picture and got it home only to realize that all  had was really sky the moon was so tiny that you couldn even tell it was really there

89;camera; after taking the time to  really learn my camera  i am thrilled with it  i m guessing i m not the only one that went from a nice  point and shoot  35 mm camera to a digital  i received mine as a holiday gift or perhaps i would have realized i was buying something beyond my  expertise  forget the manual  i had better luck with third party books  specifically  so you bought a digital camera  now what    sold at barnes  noble  sony really needs to support the buyer with a full fledged operating manual for both the camera and the accompanying pared down version of software that you get  that allows you to  use the photographs that said  my only other gripe would be the delay the  focus  feature causes in getting action shots  i always thought that holding down the shutter part way  froze the action  but now realize the camera is only freezing the  focus  and if you follow through and take the shot  it won t be the image you saw  frozen  in the display  but a second or two  later  you can always use the  movie  setting to record action  but you can t extract individual frames  as would  seem possible the quality of what you do get is amazing i love to be able to change the photo from it s original color to sepia or to black in white right on the camera without affecting the  original photo the  movie  mode has been a great way to preserve family snippets in sizes easily e mailed the battery life is incredible  i have always had the battery to do what i wanted  something that almost never happens with our sony video camera  the viewfinder comes in real handy when bright outside light renders the lcd screen invisible and it can be adjusted for those of you that wear glasses i use my camera just about every day and i am always happening upon  new features  new to  me anyways  i may have been pleased with a less expensive camera option  but i truly can t imagine being without digital now  ; after taking the time to really learn my camera  am thrilled with it   guessing   not the only one that went from  nice point and shoot mm camera to  digital  received mine as  holiday gift or perhaps  would have realized  was buying something beyond my expertise forget the manual  had better luck with third party books specifically so you bought  digital camera now what sold at barges noble sonya really needs to support the buyer with  full pledged operating manual for both the camera and the accompanying pared down version of software that you get that allows you to use the photographs that said my only other grip would be the delay the focus feature causes in getting action shots  always thought that holding down the shutter part way froze the action but now realize the camera is only freezing the focus and if you follow through and take the shot it won  be the image you saw frozen in the display but  second or two later you can always use the movie setting to record action but you can  extract individual frames as would seem possible the quality of what you do get is amazing  love to be able to change the photo from it  original color to septa or to black in white right on the camera without affecting the original photo the movie mode has been  great way to preserve family shippers in sizes easily  failed the battery life is incredible  have always had the battery to do what  wanted something that almost never happens with our sonya video camera the viewfinder comes in real handy when bright outside light renders the led screen invisible and it can be adjusted for those of you that wear glasses  use my camera just about every day and  am always happening upon new features new to me anyway  may have been pleased with  less expensive camera option but  truly can  imagine being without digital now 
90;camera; we needed a digital camera for construction site photos at work  so knowing i m a gadget and camera freak  they assigned me to be the buyer of a digital camera  i found the c 211 at a clearance sale for  135 00  here s my opinion b  what you get   intro   the olympus c 211 comes with a large set of multi lingual instruction manuals  and a quick start guide  well written  and hard to come across in this day where more and more camera makers are putting their manual on c d  disks  you of course get the c 211 camera  a neck strap and len s cap  a usb cable for photo downloading  a video cable for viewing photos on a television  a pack of polaroid 500 film  and an 8 meg smart media memory card  as you can guess  you ll want to buy a larger card  as you ll only get about 5 images on an 8 meg card at the camera s fine setting  a set of aa batteries and software c d  top off the list of in the box goods b  the good   in olympus tradition  photo quality is very good  showing lots of detail and nice  if perhaps a bit subdued  colors  with a top resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels  2 megapixel  you ll be able to print excellent 5 x 7 photos  and some pretty nice 8 x 10 photos  too  on my h p  printer using photo paper  the photos were great  but using the self serv lab printer at my local walgreens  the photos were outstanding  these self serve printers can be found at wal mart  cvs  and eckerd drug stores  too you can of course  set the camera for a lower 640 x 480 pixel size  and use these photos for email or web pages  there are two  quality  settings at this lower size  and on screen even they look very nice  with lots of details  though they will not look very good via your printer  you can however  use the c 211 s built in polaroid printer to print even these lower resolution photos with decent results  since the polaroids are only 2 x 3 inches in size  i found the polaroid prints to be decent in quality   i ve seen better from an inkjet printer of course  but they re a bit better than prints from an actual polaroid camera  in the camera s settings you can adjust the printed photos contrast and brightness  to some degree  besides the two pixel sizes of photos  you can adjust quality settings as well  either standard quality  sq  for web use  high quality  hq  for everyday photos  super high quality  shq  for prints  and tiff mode  no compression  for even more detailed larger prints  be aware that tiff prints require tons of space on a memory card  so use sparingly  and only if you really want a good 8 x 10 print the lens is a 3 x optical zoom  good  with a digital zoom option  which i avoid as digital zooms always degrade an image s quality  the lens is threaded  so you can screw on 35 5mm sized filters  a big plus to me  since many digital cameras still do not have this ability without adding awkward adapters to the lens  i recommend getting a cheap uv filter right off the bat  to protect the main lens  your lens cap will still clip on to the front of the filter  35 5mm is a somewhat awkward size  but you can find them in limited supplies at ritz camera stores  only through special order at wolf camera  however the menu and control buttons are arranged nicely on the back of the camera  next to the color lcd display  the zoom control is via a toggle type lever that surrounds the control buttons  easily reachable with your thumb  the menu button scrolls you through the camera s various settings  including setting up the camera for the 15 second  video  mode  352 pixels in size  photo quality modes  and more  a larger  print  button allows you to print the photo you re viewing on the lcd screen via the built in printer  push it  and poof  out pops a polaroid that develops fully in about 5 minutes b  the bad   the c 211 uses 4  aa sized batteries  anyone who has used digital cameras before though  knows that off the shelf alkaline batteries are eaten like candy by these things  and i found that alkalines have an extremely short life in the c 211  since there is no optical viewfinder on this camera  you must rely on the color lcd to be on at all times to compose your photos  and since the lcd is the largest battery draining part of a camera  this contributes to short battery life  15 20 shots  max  trying some rechargeable nimh batteries  my results were a bit better  maybe 50 photos using the lcd  zoom  and flash  on about one fifth of the shots  note you can use a usb memory  smart media  card reader to download your photos into the computer instead of the camera s usb cable  to conserve battery power  the lcd is as on most digital cameras  hard to see outdoors in bright sunlight  there is a flap that opens above for daylight use  that improves visibility somewhat  but just be prepared to  squint  a bit in sunlight  when composing photos  an anti glare coating on the lcd s glass would have helped  size does matter when it comes to carrying about a digital camera all day  and here  the c 211 is a whopper  roughly 9 inches tall and thick to accommodate the printer  it s big by any camera s terms  and the included neck strap is definitely needed  you will not carry this in one hand all day at the zoo  i m not sure i should list this as a  bad  thing  as again  there s simply no way they could have included a printer without the camera being this size  but if you re looking for a  carry around  digital camera  this would be a liability b  extras   the manual suggests that a 64 meg smart media card is the largest size card you can use for this camera  but i have a 128 meg card in ours  and it works fine  with the camera set at 1600 x 1200 pixels  and  shq  i can take roughly 90 photos with such a large card  cards are cheap now  so stock up so you don t run out of pixel power b  finals   in terms of digital image quality  i give the c 211 a large  thumbs up  the polaroid prints i give a  decent  grade too in quality  they have muted colors and can be a bit grainy  but again  they re better than standard polaroid camera prints usually are  in terms of size however  i have to say that i would recommend this camera more for  field use  by people in the construction field  police  fire  insurance  or real estate agents  as opposed to the casual snap shooter who wants to carry a camera to outings and gatherings  for less money  you can still find an olympus d 490  which is essentially the same camera minus the built in printer  and is much smaller if you do need a printer camera however  the c 211 is a good one to have  look for bargains  too  some stores are still trying to get  599 for this thing  and i have seen them on sale for as little as  135 00  clearance  to  249 00  occasional office max sales  so shop around  and happy snapping  ; we needed  digital camera for construction site photo at work so knowing    cadet and camera freak they assigned me to be the buyer of  digital camera  found the  at  clearance sale for here  my opinion  what you get into the polypus  comes with  large set of multi lingual instruction manual and  quick start guide well written and hard to come across in this day where more and more camera

screen via the built in printer push it and poor out pips  polaroid that develops fully in about minutes  the bad the  uses a sized batteries anyone who has used digital camera before though knows that off the shelf alkaline batteries are eaten like candy by these things and  found that alkaline have an extremely short life in the  since there is no optical viewfinder on this camera you must rely on the color led to be on at all times to compose your photo and since the led is the largest battery draining part of  camera this contributes to short battery life shots max trying some rechargeable nigh batteries my results were  bit better maybe photo using the led room and flash on about one fifth of the shots note you can use  us memory smart media card reader to download your photo into the computer instead of the camera  us cable to conserve battery power the led is as on most digital camera hard to see outdoor in bright sunlight there is  flap that opens above for daylight use that improves visibility somewhat but just be prepared to quiet  bit in sunlight when composing photo an anti glare coating on the led  glass would have helped size does matter when it comes to carrying about  digital camera all day and here the  is  whisper roughly inches tall and thick to accommodate the printer it  big by any camera  terms and the included neck strap is definitely needed you will not carry this in one hand all day at the too   not sure  should list this as  bad thing as again there  simply no way they could have included  printer without the camera being this size but if you re looking for  carry around digital camera this would be  liability  extra the manual suggests that  meg smart media card is the largest size card you can use for this camera but  have  meg card in ours and it works fine with the camera set at  pipes and she  can take roughly photo with such  large card cards are cheap now so stock up so you don  run out of fixed power  final in terms of digital image quality  give the   large thumbs up the polaroid prints  give  decent grade too in quality they have mute colors and can be  bit grain but again they re better than standard polaroid camera prints usually are in terms of size however  have to say that  would recommend this camera more for field use by people in the construction field police fire insurance or real estate agents as opposed to the casual snap shorter who wants to carry  camera to outing and gatherings for less money you can still find an polypus  which is essentially the same camera minus the built in printer and is much smaller if you do need  printer camera however the  is  good one to have look for bargain too some stores are still trying to get for this thing and  have seen them on sale for as little as clearance to occasional office max sales so shop around and happy snapping

98;camera;  sony mavica takes cd r technology on the road  i ve been a nikon disciple for over 10 years  but the new cd capable sony mavica lured me away from the digital coolpix series  while planning a trip to europe  i decided my venerable nikon cp 900 just wasn t up to the vacation photo task anymore  i wanted more control than the 900 could offer  precise aperture and shutter priorities  manual focusing  finer ev compensation  and external flash options the two latest nikon offerings  the cp 990 and the professional d1 both fit the bill  we d all be using the d1 if we could afford it  but after consulting the checkbook  my considerations came down to either updating my nikon or braving the waters on a first generation product with the new sony mavica cd 1000  the destination for my digital work is primarily the web  so the difference between a 2 or 3 megapixel camera is negligible  if my final product is a print  there is still no substitute for film b much better image quality than previous mavicas  in the past  i ve been a snob for the  quot nikkor glass quot  and that influenced my decision in the digital format as well  with the previous generations of mavicas  the floppy file size limitation put the image quality far below my standards  nevermind the quality of the glass  with a firm step forward  sony has broken through that barrier by exchanging the floppies for cds  increasing the capacity a hundredfold  now that the new mavica isn t crippled by disk size  the real quality of the photos can be seen without the overbearing jpg compression  while based on the same body and electronics  the cd 1000 s normal file size is three times larger than it s sister mavica fd 95  that means less lossy compression and cleaner originals  there s even the option to write totally uncompressed tiffs  and this is the one camera that has the storage capacity to do it the new cd 1000 covered most of my wishlist  giving me much more manual control than the previous 900 i was used to  i m still waiting for the day when i can match my favorite glass to a digital ccd  but until then  this new sony will fit the bill  the new mavica offers one important advantage over the nikon as a vacation camera  while traveling abroad  the cd r capable mavica has unchained me from the laptop  instead of the hourly chore of moving all the images to a hard drive to clear up room  i can now simply swap in a new disc   6 for a pack of 5  each one holds 170 full resolution images b still camera in camcorder clothing  the most unsuspecting feature i ve found is the brilliant image stabilization technology  while using the long 10x telephoto or the macro mode  this jitter reducing feature really gives you a tack sharp photo even with less than steady hands  you can now forget the tripod for quick macro shots  this still camera acts more like a modified video unit than a traditional slr  and borrows heavily from sony s camcorder expertise  it has a comfortable slr feel with an ergonomic grip  in one way i admire the larger  more traditional pro sumer look  but i also miss the stealth possible from the small rotating coolpix body  add on the external flash  bracket  and a lumiquest  and this mavica will let you mix slyly in with any pro photographers  my standard film gear includes nikon f3s and old heavy lenses  so the bulkiness and weight isn t a detraction to me  but be warned that this is one of the largest digicams you re likely to lift the lens paired with the cd 1000 is a 10x monster that gives you the 35mm equivalent of 39 390mm  for my shooting style  i d much rather have something on the wider end and less telephoto  necessary accessories include the wide angle adapter  50  and external flash unit  100  luckily  this camera frees you from the coolpix necessary accessories of batteries  charger  and a card reader  the mavica includes sony s smart lithium ion battery technology which recharges inside of the camera and also communicates with the body to let you know exactly how many minutes of life it has left  the battery recharges in 3 to 4 hours  lasts over two hours with lcd  and extras are  50 each  another unique feature of the sony is dual lcd screens  a decent one on the back and another inside the viewfinder  turning off the larger one saves battery power  and having the smaller one allows you to shoot just like an slr b great piece but too expensive  of course there are downsides with any first generation product  the durability of a portable cd writing mechanism is often questioned  but this mavica has performed flawlessly so far  even while trying to make the laser skip when writing  this delay while the cd records brings up the biggest frustration with the new mavica  the wait from pressing the shutter to the next available frame is still far too long  i understand this is a limit of the technology  but why not use a simple ram buffer to allow a series of 5 photos before having to write to the disc  the delay actually isn t as bad as i expected  often between 3 and 4 seconds  about the same as my old nikon which was simply writing to a smartmedia card  despite the long reaching telephoto and image stabilization  this camera is not capable of high level sports photography  anything above little league  and the action will be too fast for the camera to handle   of course  this can be said about any digital camera currently under  5000  the manual focusing ring is too small and not precise enough for quick follow focusing skills  while a digicam with manual focus might interest those wanting more control  trying to focus the small grainy lcd is nothing like using a bright slr viewfinder the mavica cd 1000 isn t the perfect digicam  but it may be the best yet in combining quality imaging with ease of use while still allowing enough manual adjustment for the pro in all of us  it is currently overpriced  you pay a  300 premium for the cd capability over the sister mavica  but should be in the  1000 range soon enough  sony put together a great package of features and finally produced a model that will get the attention of serious amateur photographers

mavra d isn  the perfect digital but it may be the best yet in combining quality imagine with ease of use while still allowing enough manual adjustment for the pro in all of us it is currently overpriced you pay  premium for the d capability over the sister mavra but should be in the range soon enough sonya put together  great package of features and finally produced  model that will get

99;auto; first of i must say i am a gm person  it 146s not that often that i find myself straying from the gm pack  but because of certain reason i now find myself looking for an new car and as a joke i went to the local hyundai dealership to test drive a new tiburon with the 2 7l v6  by the end of the test drive i found that what i thought would be a poorly built joke to be a very nice affordable sports coupe that gives competition a huge run for the money b first impressions i exterior b i there were 2 models i was looking at one was silver the other was black  both had very unique styling  this gave it a very sporty and appealing look  i noticed the large sport spoiler which made the car look even better  the tail lights gave the car a sporty look but also offered other motorist visibility  it also had dual exhaust which sounded amazing when the sales person fired up the car  i couldn 146t resist and had to take it for a spin b i interior b i when getting in the car i had mixed feelings  the first thing i noticed was leather seats  and what got me was not only did it have leather seats but they are standard in the v6 model  what cars do you know that offer standard leather seats for under 20k  the dash and gauges seemed a little plain which is where i get the mixed feelings from  but really when looking at the overall design of the car it fits in quite nice  and with the dealership installed dash kit you can add some color and make them look fantastic  the sets were a little stiff and i m not sure how well the leather seats would hold up long term  the gauges are easy to read it did take me awhile to get everything adjusted  but i wouldn 146t really consider that as to being a design problem b the test drive b i have had an automatic for the last 2 years so i was expecting to kill the car a few times due to some hills and snow  however not once in the test drive did i kill the car or did it hesitate  the 6 speed manual was extremely simple to operate  the only thing that we couldn 146t figure out was how to put the car in reverse  it took about 10 min to figure it out  you have to pull up on the handle and then put it in reverse  i headed straight for the highway after leaving the dealership to see what the v6 6 speed combo was made of  there was a base mustang next to me in the other lane  and he was showing off trying to be cool  so i decided to test shifting  i downshifted and took of down the street  the look on the guys face was worth the test drive alone  the gears are easy to find and the clutch is excellent  indianapolis is going through a lot or road construction so there were a lot of bumps and bad roads  the car did well over them but at times it seemed the car was so stiff that it just kind of jumps over them  that created a somewhat harsh ride quality b specifications b the hyundai coupe is offered in either 2 0l 4 cylinder  producing 133hp 4800 rpm  or 2 7l v6  producing 177 4000 rpm  both have a standard 5 speed manual with an optional 4 speed shiftronic automatic  the v6 model has an available 6 speed manual available with a package group  front suspension on both is an independent mcpherson struts w coil springs and a rear independents multi link with coil springs  sport tuned n the v6 models  4 wheel disc brakes are standard all around abs is optional  16  silver painted alloy wheels are standard on the base model and the automatic v6 model  17  machine finish alloy wheels are standard on the manual v6 s b i dimensions exterior b i wheelbase 99 6 length 173 0 height 52 3 width 69 3 track  front rear  58 7 b i interior b i head room  fr rear  38 0 34 4 leg room 43 0 29 9 shoulder room 53 9 50 6 hip room 51 6 44 7 cargo volume 14 7 passenger volume 81 9 b i epa b i 2 0l 4 cyl   city highway 5 speed manual 23 31 4 speed auto 23 30 2 7l v6  city highway 6 speed manual 18 26 5 speed manual 19 26 4 speed auto 20 26 fuel capacity 14 5 gallons b pricing b the base tiburon  if that 146s what you want to call it  starts at 16 7k  with destination charge  with the standard package  the only thing that 146s optional is the rear spoiler  leather seats  sunroof  and abs  the auto starts at 17 6k b i the tiburon gt v6   starts at 18 5k with the 5 speed manual transmission  18 7k for the 6 speed manual and 19 4k for the shiftronic automatic  options for the gt model include sunroof  abs  aluminum foot covers  and high body spoiler on the gt 6 speed  ; first of  must say  am  go person it  not that often that  find myself straying from the go pack but because of certain reason  now find myself looking for an new car and as  joke  went to the local hyundai leadership to test drive  new tiburon with the   by the end of the test drive  found that what  thought would be  poorly built joke to be  very nice unfordable sports couple that gives competition  huge run for the money  first impressions  exterior   there were models  was looking at one was silver the other was black both had very unique saying this gave it  very sport and appealing look  noticed the large sport spoiled which made the car look even better the tail lights gave the car  sport look but also offered other motorist visibility it also had dual exhaust which sounded amazing when the sales person fired up the car  couldn  resist and had to take it for  spin   interior   when getting in the car  had mixed feelings the first thing  noticed was leather seats and what got me was not only did it have leather seats but they are standard in the  model what cars do you know that offer standard leather seats for under  the dash and gauge seemed  little plain which is where  get the mixed feelings from but really when looking at the overall design of the car it fits in quite nice and with the leadership installed dash kit you can add some color and make them look fantastic the sets were  little stiff and   not sure how well the leather seats would hold up long term the gauge are easy to read it did take me awhile to get everything adjusted but  wouldn  really consider that as to being  design problem  the test drive   have had an automatic for the last years so  was expecting to kill the car  few times due to some hills and snow however not once in the test drive did  kill the car or did it hesitate the speed manual was extremely simple to operate the only thing that we couldn  figure out was how to put the car in reverse it took about min to figure it out you have to pull up on the handle and then put it in reverse  headed straight for the highway after leaving the leadership to see what the  speed comb was made of there was  base mustn next to me in the other lane and he was showing off trying to be cool so  decided to test shifting  downshifted and took of down the street the look on the guns face was worth the test drive alone the years are easy to find and the clutch is excellent indianapolis is going through  lot or road construction so there were  lot of bump and bad roads the car did well over them but at times it seemed the car was so stiff that it just kind of jumps over them that created  somewhat harsh ride quality  specification  the hyundai couple is offered in either  cylinder producing he rum or   producing rum both have  standard speed manual with an optional speed shiftronic automatic the  model has an available speed manual available with  package group front suspension on both is an independent mcpherson strut  coil springs and  rear independent multi link with coil springs sport tuned  the  models wheel disc rakes are standard all around as is optional silver painted allow wheels are standard on the base model and the automatic  model machine finish allow wheels are standard on the manual     dimensions exterior   wheelbase length height width track front rear   interior   head room fr rear leg room shoulder room hip room cargo volume passenger volume   pa    cy city highway speed manual speed auto   city highway speed manual speed manual speed auto fuel capacity gallows  pricking  the base tiburon if that  what you want to call it starts at  with destination charge with the standard package the only thing that  optional is the rear spoiled leather seats sunroof and as the auto starts at    the tiburon it  starts at  with the speed manual transmission  for the speed manual and  for the shiftronic automatic option for the it model include sunroof as aluminium foot covers and high body spoiled on the it speed 
100;auto; back in january i started looking for a new car to replace my acura integra  it ultimately came down to the bmw 328ci and audi a4 2 8  i liked the more aggressive styling of the bmw 3 series but i couldn t justify the  38 000 price tag for the 328ci  about  5k more for essentially 20 more horsepower vs  the 323ci  so in the ultimate feat of rationalization i opted for the audi s4 which was  2k more than the 328ci  with the added benefit of 60 more horsepower  full time 4 wheel drive  and an extra 2 doors   i ended up ordering a 2001 model at the end of march and it arrived at the dealer at the end of june  the major differences between the 2000 and 2001 models are  1   1k higher sticker price  2  addition of esp  electronic stability program  3  sport package became an added cost option  and 4  longer warranty  4yr 50k mi  be prepared for a wait if you plan on purchasing the s4 since it s a limited production car  especially in california i ve had my 2001 s4 for about 1700 miles now  and i ve loved every single mile of it  it s metallic silver with the onyx  black  interior  with the premium package  aka convenience package on the 2000 model  and bose audio system  i opted to not get the 6 disc changer option since the oem unit  panasonic  can be had for  279 aftermarket vs   650 installed with the car b engine performance  this car is a pleasure to drive  it s got incredible torque at low rpm s  258 lb ft   1850 3600 rpm  so acceleration is effortless  and downright wicked if you floor it  it took a while for me to get used to the car s power as i was unintentionally launching like a rocket at green lights since i was used to the engine of my former  torque weak  acura integra  also  the car is very composed at highway speeds  so much so that i often don t realize that i was going 80  mph when i thought i was going 60 since the cabin is very quiet and composed the six speed took a little getting used to since the reverse gear is next to 1 2  you push down  then left past 1 2  then up whereas on my integra it was down from 5th gear  the throws are much longer as well  feels like you ll be elbowing people in the back seat  which is the only real driveability drawback that i see in this otherwise amazing car  an aftermarket short shifter is definitely on the upgrade list the car is after all a 4 door sedan  so it s not nearly as tossable as my old integra  there is more lean that i would like when i toss the car from side to side  but it s pretty taut for a stock suspension  regardless  i feel it s got a good balance between performance and comfort  i ve autocrossed the car once  and it definitely needs a stiffer and lower suspension for these type of events  but for everyday driving it s a good compromise oh yeah  there is quite a lively aftermarket for the s4 there are at least 4 aftermarket tuners that you can go to for a new ecu which will easily bump your horsepower in the 310 hp range  stock is 250hp  and torque into the 360 ft lbs range  stock is 258 ft lbs  for about  500 600  so if you ever tire of the stock 250hp engine  you ve got options  b interior  the front seats are comfortable and i never felt fatigued from the seats during extended driving  i wish the side bolsters were a little more beefy or adjustable  though  the rear seats are quite cramped  and i wished audi would have made the cavernous trunk a little smaller so that passengers would have a little more legroom  they d almost be more comfortable laying down in the trunk  if you ve ever seen the truck of the s4 a4 you ll know what i mean    if the trunk wasn t big enough for you  you can also fold down the 60 40 rear seats and fit your groceries for the next 6 months in there  audi placed 2 cup holders under the center arm rest hello  you need to keep the arm rest up if you want to use either of these cup holders  but luckily there is a neat little retractable cup holder in the center console that you have more direct access to driving with the sunroof open at highway speeds creates a loud droning sound between 35 45 mph  this is very annoying  but my solution is to drive faster   it s unexcusable  though  to have this happen on a  40k  car  never had this problem in my integra  there is also wind noise from the side mirrors at highway speeds  a slight whistling sound  too to use the cruise control you have to fiddle with a stalk on the steering column  to accelerate after you activated cruise control  you press the button on the end of the stalk  but to slow down you have to use a different slider switch  which also serves to turn the cruise on off  clumsy to say the least  i wish they placed the controls on the steering wheel like my old integra b exterior  the avus rims are a huge brake dust magnet  i ve been told that applying car wax to the rims will help with cleaning  any which way  i think i ll be cleaning off brake dust quite often  i didn t like the styling of the rims initially  but it has grown on me and now i like them b audio  the bose system sounds pretty decent for a stock radio  albeit a little too heavy on the bass  i listen to a lot of bass heavy music  trance  house  hip hop  etc  so the system s bass heavy emphasis works nicely for me  but it gets a little irratating after prolonged listening sometimes  i haven t really cranked it up  but i have heard from others that the bass gets muddy at higher volumes as well b maintenance  every 2001 audi comes with a 4yr 50 000 mile warranty  2001 models received a longer warranty than previous years  during which time all scheduled maintenance is included with the car purchase even down to replacing windshield wipers b summary  wow  go get one  you won t be disappointed  you ll notice that the negatives that i wrote up are really all minor nit picks consider this a plus since i really don t see any major downpoints with this car br br  ; back in january  started looking for  new car to replace my acute

103;camera; after years of using my yashica f109 35mm slr  with a manual focus  for occasions such as parties  weddings  etc  i was ready for an upgrade  i initially intended to buy a fully automatic 35mm film camera  as prices are very competitive these days  my hesitation with a digital camera purchase was my belief that the pictures would not be comparable in quality with that of a good film camera  however  after looking at photos taken by a friend with a fuji 3mp camera  i was convinced that i could be happy with a digital camera and jumped on the  net to do some research   actually  epinions com was one of the first places i visited  and yes  the three reviews above did help me make my decision  after realizing the obvious benefits of owning a digital camera  i made a short list of the cameras i could afford  since i only wanted to spend about 300 00  and headed to circuit city  i chose the d550 because of it s price  size  and features  the camera comes with the  standard  16 mb card  but hey  all of the cameras i looked at had the same thing   i purchased a 64mb card for another  35 00  after bringing the camera home and opening the package  i discovered the first of only three issues i have with this camera to date   the manual provided inside the box is very small  and does not include all the info you want or need  yes  there is a more detailed manual on the cd  but who wants to boot up a computer just to read about spot metering  anyhow  i read the manual and immediately began taking pictures  the menus on the lcd screen are not complicated  and easy to navigate  you can also post thumbnail type pics on the screen  9 at a time  to view what you have so far on disk  for a person with their first digital camera  that was a pleasant suprise  i was really impressed with the picture quality  after using the  zoom in  feature to take a closer look at the picture as it was displayed on the lcd  i took several pics in different settings   low light  daytime outdoors  and interior with artificial light  the real test  however  was how the pics would look after being printed out  i hooked it up to my computer which runs on win 98  and it took with no problems  the cd included has a detailed manual  along with the camedia 4 0 software  after installing the camera s driver  however  i discovered the second issue   there is no ac adaptor included with the camera  so you have to use the battery power to transfer your pictures to the computer  and it doesn t seem that the batteries last long when you re doing so much with the camera taking pics  previewing them  and then transfering to the pc  yes  the camera must be  on  for you to transfer the pics  what i ended up doing was buying a  15 00 pny smartmedia card reader writer   usb  and installed that instead  now  i just take the card out of the camera  and isert it into the reader  i save my camera s batteries  and the reader writer requires no power supply  the pics transfer at a good rate  and my problem is solved  i then tested the software  which i must say i m happy with  now i m no professional photographer  and you probably aren t either  so i d say that most people are like me and would be more than happy with the software  it allows you to preview the pics  crop  resize  rotate  add text or clean up the pics  and lets you not only print out the pics in different packages  but has templates for greeting cards  post cards  calenders  etc  yeah  the templates aren t endless  but what do you want for  300 00  photoshop 7 from adobe  the software is more than adequate  i printed out several pics using my cannon s600  which only prints at 1200 x 1200  and i must say i m very impressed  i printed out one 5 x 7  a calender with a good size pic on it  and 9 wallet size pics on a single sheet  all of the pictures came out great  and i have absolutely no complaints about their quality  the drag and drop ease of the software makes it a breeze to use  so  although i have to insert the cd to read the more detailed instructions  i m happy with my purchase choice  you won t go wrong with this camera  i can t speak about shutter speeds yet  because i haven t tested this camera a ability to shoot moving targets  personally  that s not what i bought the camera for  so far  though  this camera has not failed to impress me  it s exactly what i needed  and i am now officially part of the digital camera enthusiasts  club  my next obsession will probably be a 12 megapixel digital slr   wow  what will that be like  ;

106;camera; even i am sometimes guilty of the spontaneous purchase   the thrill of saying  quot yeah i ll take it quot  with absolutely no clue whether what you re buying is a quality item or is even worth the price of the fluff sitting at the bottom of your pocket buying the dsc s30 was one of those moments  and while it was an exciting purchase  my wife and i have wanted a digital camera for ages  there was that little voice softly saying  quot but what if it s a lemon quot  thankfully  we ignored that little voice  because this time throwing caution to the wind paid off big time  not only had we made a good choice  but in fact we d made  the  good choice the camera was bought at sears  they had the price set at the full retail of  499  with a price match to the local best buy of  399 and the sony rebate of  100  for also buying a vaio  that s another tale  the final price was  299 plus tax  just beautiful  what s even more satisfying is that it s easily worth  499 when considering what other similar cameras are going for now so on to the camera setting it up was a breeze  really just a few short steps  attach the lens cover  attach the carrying strap  plug in the battery  or hook up to wall power  insert the memory stick  and you re off  or so i thought  interesting anecdote here  and remember that i was new to digital cameras  i got it all set up  thanks to the manual  which is straightforward  and tried to take a picture  i pressed the shutter button  heard a beep  saw something on the lcd  but no picture  what  i tried a million different things  from formatting the memory stick to using different resolutions to adjusting the flash  the focus  you name it  i learned a lot about the camera during that mad frenzy to take a picture  that s for sure  i was just about ready to give up and call it broken when i noticed something in the manual about  quot press the shutter button halfway quot  oh  duh with that out of the way  i took about 20 pictures of everything i could find in the house  my wife  the cat  a pumpkin  myself  nothing was safe  it was so much fun let s go over the pros of the camera b display b  the lcd display is very bright and crisp  and aiming the camera using it seems natural  you can even make it brighter with a slider on the side of the camera  navigating the camera s many features using the on screen interface is painless and intuitive  sony s menu system is arranged very nicely and the one button controller works surprisingly well  i was able to try out most of the features for the first time without referring to the manual b battery b  sony s infolithium battery charges fully in a bit less than two hours  and according to the manual lasts that long while in use  my own experiences seem to agree with this  a very nice feature is that the camera reports the approximate number of minutes of charge remaining on the battery  very handy b memory stick b  sony s proprietary memory system  these little sticks hold memory up to 128mb and i hear that 256 and 512mb versions are on the way  that s a lot of pictures  understatement  we picked up a 16mb stick with the camera for about  30  since it only comes with 4mb  the only problem i can see with these sticks is that they re so small   it d be very easy to lose track of one  transfers from the memory stick  inside the camera  to the pc are a snap  the camera comes with a usb cable   just connect the cable between the camera and the pc  the first time you do this  it will install some drivers  included on a cd with the camera  and away you go  the memory stick from that point on is recognized by windows as a removeable drive  and the files are stored there as jpg or tiff  so you can simply copy them from there to your hard drive  or view them right from the memory stick  couldn t hardly be easier b lens picture quality  the lens is a 3x optical zoom lens  with up to 6x digital zoom  another great feature of the camera is that the level of zoom is displayed on a bar on the lcd when it s being adjusted  even better is that it indicates when you re leaving optical zoom and entering digital zoom mode  it also has a macro mode  good for focus at down to 3cm  practically a microscope at that level   you can easily make a dime fill the entire display and still be in focus  the picture quality is just outstanding as well  colors are vibrant and seem true  for a camera in this price range  i was impressed b extras  the camera is loaded with features  but a couple stand out to me  first off  you can hook up the output of the lcd display to a tv or anything with a composite video input  using a supplied cable  this means you can hook it up to a vcr and actually use it as a movie camera  wow  of course you re limited by the length of the cable  but still  also  the slide show mode is awesome  in this mode  as you d expect  it cycles through all the photos currently on the memory stick  now combine these two features  and you have a stroke of sony genius  run a slide show of your photos on your tv  the quality of output to the tv is really really good   i was amazed by how good it looked  one final feature i m glad they included was the ability to store images in uncompressed tiff format  even though it s a memory hog  it s really worth it  you tend to forget that jpg does degrade image quality since it looks so good  but comparing the two you definitely notice artifacts in the jpg output  take a few photos using the camera s highest resolution in tiff format if you want to impress your friends the cons  yes there are a couple b no optical viewfinder b  most of the time this isn t an issue  because the digital viewfinder is so bright  but in extremely bright conditions  an optical viewfinder would have been nice b lens button design b  i m not terribly fond of the placement for the buttons which operate the user interface  the problem is that i tend to use the thumb of my left hand to use these buttons  and in this position it s natural for the forefingers of this hand to grasp the camera by the lens  often i have to remember not to do that  a minor gripe to be sure  but a gripe nonetheless conclusion this camera practically has it all and then some  with a few bonus features i wasn t expecting  in its price class it can t be beat  and i am extremely pleased with my  quot accidental quot  purchase  very highly recommended br br  ; even  am sometimes guilty of the spontaneous purchase the thrill of saying quit yeah  ll take it quit with absolutely no clue whether what you re buying is  quality item or is even worth the price of the fluff sitting at the bottom of your pocket buying the duc  was one of those moments and while it was an exciting purchase my wife and  have wanted

hours and according to the manual lasts that long while in use my own experiences seem to agree with this  very nice feature is that the camera reports the approximate number of minutes of charge remaining on the battery very handy  memory stick  sonya  proprietary memory system these little sticks hold memory up to mb and  hear that and mb versions are on the way that   lot of pictures understatement we picked up  mb stick with the camera for about since it only comes with mb the only problem  can see with these sticks is that they re so small it  be very easy to lose track of one transfers from the memory stick inside the camera to the pp are  snap the camera comes with  us cable just connect the cable between the camera and the pp the first time you do this it will install some drivers included on  d with the camera and away you go the memory stick from that point on is recognized by windows as  removable drive and the files are stored there as pg or stiff so you can simply copy them from there to your hard drive or view them right from the memory stick couldn  hardly be easier  lens picture quality the lens is   optical room lens with up to  digital room another great feature of the camera is that the level of room is displayed on  bar on the led when it  being adjusted even better is that it indicates when you re leaving optical room and entering digital room mode it also has  micro mode good for focus at down to cm practically  microscope at that level you can easily make  time fill the entire display and still be in focus the picture quality is just outstanding as well colors are vagrant and seem true for  camera in this price range  was impressed  extra the camera is loaded with features but  couple stand out to me first off you can hook up the output of the led display to  to or anything with  composite video input using  supplied cable this means you can hook it up to  ver and actually use it as  movie camera now of course you re limited by the length of the cable but still also the slide show mode is awesome in this mode as you  expect it cycle through all the photo currently on the memory stick now combine these two features and you have  stroke of sonya genius run  slide show of your photo on your to the quality of output to the to is really really good  was amazed by how good it looked one final feature   glad they included was the ability to store images in compressed stiff format even though it   memory how it  really worth it you tend to forget that pg does degraded image quality since it looks so good but comparing the two you definitely notice artifacts in the pg output take  few photo using the camera  highest resolution in stiff format if you want to impress your friends the sons yes there are  couple  no optical viewfinder  most of the time this isn  an issue because the digital viewfinder is so bright but in extremely bright conditions an optical viewfinder would have been nice  lens button design    not terribly fond of the placement for the buttons which operate the user interface the problem is that  tend to use the thumb of my left hand to use these buttons and in this position it  natural for the forefingers of this hand to grasp the camera by the lens often  have to remember not to do that  minor grip to be sure but  grip nonetheless conclusion this camera practically has it all and then some with  few bonus features  wasn  expecting in its price class it can  be beat and  am extremely pleased with my quit accidental quit purchase very highly recommended br br 
107;auto; the toyota solara convertible is a huge mistake by toyota  it is a butchered stock solara instead of a convertible built from the ground up the solara is a good car in many respects  pre convertible conversion  the acceleration is outstanding on the v6 and it is loaded with lots of amenities if you are willing to pay enough  this includes power everything  leather upholstery  etc as for the convertible  the chopped off top results in a lack of stability in the structure and you gets a noisy uncomfortable ride  the top itself is poorly designed and does not seem to be 100  air tight  occasionally droplets of water will sneak in  and you will have lots of road noise  the car rides quieter with the top down another annoying feature is that you cannot bring the top back up unless you are in park  the chrysler sebring allows you to do it if you are going slow enough so if you are caught in 5mph traffic with exhaust in your face  you cannot bring the top up toyota needs to redesign this from scratch to get it right  ; the tooth solar convertible is  huge mistake by tooth it is  butcher stock solar instead of  convertible built from the ground up the solar is  good car in many respects pre convertible conversion the acceleration is outstanding on the  and it is loaded with lots of amenities if you are willing to pay enough this includes power everything leather upholstery etc as for the convertible the chopped off top results in  lack of stability in the structure and you gets  noisy uncomfortable ride the top itself is poorly designed and does not seem to be air tight occasionally droplets of water will speak in and you will have lots of road noise the car rides quieter with the top down another annoying feature is that you cannot bring the top back up unless you are in park the chrysler seeing allows you to do it if you are going slow enough so if you are caught in may traffic with exhaust in your face you cannot bring the top up tooth needs to design this from scratch to get it right 
108;camera; before i go any further  i ll let you know right now that i really like this camera  but as with any product  there are a few things i would change  also  the customer service at kodak is horrible i think the camera takes really good quality pictures  the colors are very bright  and the images are sharp  it has three different image quality settings  and also allows you to choose between megapixel resolution and 640 x 480 resolution  the second option is especially good because sometimes you don t want huge screen filling pictures that the megapixel setting records  so you can take the picture at the lower resolution  this option is especially good when designing websites with the quality set to the highest  and the resolution in megapixel mode  the camera takes about 25 pictures with the 8 mb compact flash card that is included  but another payoff of the 640 x 480 setting is that when set at this resolution at highest quality mode  the camera can literally take about 60 pictures on the 8 mb card  i think that s awesome  i ended up buying another 8 mb card  and with just the two cards i had more than enough space to take pictures on my first trip to new york city earlier this month the user interface is another really good feature of the camera  the on screen menu options are really easy to understand and are in a really user friendly font type  ok  here are some pet peeves about the camera  it eats batteries like no other  i ve found that the rate that the camera uses batteries  4 aa s  is amazing  i bought some rechargeable batteries and a recharger and that solved my problem  the camera is pretty hefty  it s a lot heavier than my last camera  and has kind of a bulky shape  it won t fit easily into your pocket    the rubber covers covering the ac adapter connection  the transfer cable connection  and the output connection at the side of the camera are kind of cheap feeling and flimsy  the time it takes to transfer pictures is really slow  a lot slower than my first camera the absolute worst problem with the camera  something kodak really needs to work on is it s phone based support  it is horrible  i really cannot stress how negative my experience in this area has been  my ac adapter broke  and i called to send it in to be repaired under warranty  the minimum waiting time any time i called was 15 minutes  i sent the camera to kodak  but instead of coming back in 7 10 days like they said  it arrived 3 weeks later  but to make things worse  the first time i used the adapter  i found that they had not fixed the problem  i had to call back repeatedly  one time being put on hold for over an hour  the reps are nice  but the waiting time is horrible and i m really mad that i have to go through the hassle again since they didn t fix it the first time ok  that s pretty much the end of my commentary on the camera  overall  i d say it s really good camera  a 4for sure  but get s downgraded to a 3 because of my horrible experience on hold for hours upon hours with kodak  if you d like to read on  it s just the story of how i got the camera and it compared to my last one  the dc 210 plus zoom is my second digital camera  my first was a pretec brand camera that my mom bought me off of aol before i went to college  it was a 640 x 480 pixel camera that had no zoom  that was a good first camera  but after a while i really wanted a zoom lens and better quality pictures   that first camera cost about  225 i think i began looking around for a camera that had a zoom lens  megapixel ability  and good quality pictures  i literally spent hours browsing different websites trying to decide which to buy  i visited about every different site that had reviews of cameras and comparison tests of digital cameras  for the money  it seemed that the kodak was the best bet i didn t buy the camera out of any retail store  but instead i bought it on ebay from a camera shop in washington for  266  including shipping  this was a great price  i bought it and ended up giving my old one to my brother  my first camera was a great one  but the pictures on the kodak are a lot better br br  ;

109;camera; the hp 612 is a good family camera  it works as a point and shot for all the family tech idiots  which includes most of the population  but will do enough fancy stuff to keep the shutter savvy busy for a while  if you want to focus other than center  you can with this one  you can zoom  flash settings are adjustable  including a shut off for those moments ruined by a photo flash bombs busting in air  but  you don t have to worry about anything if you are a  look in the hole   or lcd screen  kind of person  there are 3 basic kinds of digital cameras you can buy  the old ones with the 3 5 disc storage are being phased out  though it seems a nice idea to have the photos on the 3 5  you can t store much  you have a bulky camera and disks all over the place  the newest cd  mini  size are really high dollar  but they may very well be the ones that come out on top  that leaves the mid range cameras like the hp 612 that use memory cards which are similar to the 3 5 disks but are smaller and hold a lot more  when i looked over the compact flash style cameras  i decided to go with the hp 612  there were several reasons i went with this one after reading online and trying out digital cameras at work and with family cameras  i just have no shame at all and will say   let me check that out  so  here is how i decided        you don t have to be a rocket scientist to use this camera b  since i have two little boys and one who especially loves to take pictures  i wanted a camera that was really easy to use  eli could not take photos with the canon digital from work  it was just too complex  even the college students had a heck of time getting anything worth printing  this one involves looking in the viewfinder hole and then pushing the button  it works just like his canon owl 35 mm point and shoot which is a wonderful starter camera for little guys  the box button on the back of the hp above the lcd viewer means that the shot shows in the lcd to check out shots  just push the button  and that is just one click in addition to pushing the top button to take the picture  eli uses both those options easy as pie point and shoot and then almost easy as pie with the lcd  it took him about 5 minutes to nail the basics on this camera  and he is 9 years old   it s pocket size b  no one wants to be the holder of the stuff  at the best you can do if you have kids  you have all kinds of things that you have to haul around  i never thought i would carry the monster purse  since i usually jammed my important stuff in my levi s pocket  now  i do carry the purse   and this camera can be tucked right in for the ride  it is the size of the regular 35mm quick pic cameras  the hp doesn t come with any sort of case  so i would suggest that you protect it with something  you can buy the case  or you can use any kind of sturdy little bag  i have a little drawstring denim bag that works just fine  it keeps the camera clean and protects it  the carry handle is not the greatest and won t go around you neck  but it s ok  i keep the camera in my purse or around my wrist   you can buy your batteries at the quick trip on the corner b  ok  i know that aa batteries are not the best way to go  but i like a camera that will work with the garden variety batteries  perhaps this bias comes from living overseas where i had to point and grunt  i hated to need things that i could not describe even in english  i still do not know how to say sage in greek  and i did not have sage in the dressing balls i made that thanksgiving  dressing balls are not very good without sage  give me batteries i can recognize at a glance  anyway  this camera will work with any aa batteries you stick in the bottom  it holds four of those  they do not last very long  we run through a set of four almost every time we take pictures  our style is to carry the camera around for a couple of hours and shoot things at a birthday party or at a cook out  we run about 2 rolls per set of batteries in the 35 mm world or about 48 digital pics  if i am the keeper of the camera and i m more careful about the juice  then i can get around double  the average adult could get 100 photos on a set of batteries  right now  i am saving up to get the charger that plugs in the wall socket for rechargeable batteries  we have that at work  and it is a good idea  you charge and use the batteries over and over  that will be pretty expensive  but it does pay off in the long run  if you can afford the charger and recharge batteries  i would suggest that you get 2 sets of batteries and rotate those in the camera  you can always fall back on the regular aa when you have to b if you re thinking about getting this camera  then you do need to buy some other things        oh sigh wish it all came together b  the real must have would be the media card  actually  it works out really nice to have two of those  they are like the 3 5 disks  but they are smaller  just take the camera to the store and say you need a media card  or  you can look in the booklet and find out what you need and buy online  check out fat wallet  www fatwallet com  and click at the top to forums and watch the message strings  you ll see good deals come up  i got a smart media card for half the local price by doing that  but i got the first one at the local store to make sure i got the right thing  the reason you want the media cards is that the camera has only 8 bites of memory  that means about 24 pics stored depending on the quality you set that for  the default is the mid range  if you can take the time to check and then discard all unwanted pics on the spot to make room for more or if you stay at home all the time and can upload the photos  then you may be ok  i wouldn t bank on that though  if you get some pics on the camera and not on the disk  then you can read the booklet that comes with the camera and upload right from the camera to the disk  that is much easier i think  i try not to put any pics on the 8 mb on the camera  but sometimes i forget the memory card and then have pics there on the camera which don t show when you stick in the memory card  media cards come in lots of sizes as far as what they hold  they all look the same on the outside other than the numbers printed  i go with 64 for that and have 2 of them  they hold about 125 photos  which is enough around here  i keep one in the camera and one in the printer most times and switch out when one gets full  that reminds me to look and see what i want to get rid of or print  you don t have to buy a printer  you can use the one you have if it is color  do buy photo paper though  so the pictures will look like pictures  it s nicer to have a printer made for photos though  i got the hp 1115  the nice thing here is that i can put the memory card right in the printer and then make 4 6 photos on the spot by the numbers of the shots  it does not show the picture on the printer  though it seems like a nice idea to have all those memories stored on disk  it is just not the same to have computer pictures  they are not as much fun to look at as hard copies  one way around the printer problem is that you can take the pics and then upload to snapfish  www snapfish com  once you have the pics up and can look at them  you can edit at sf and then can order the prints you want  that s a little extra work  but that can work out if you don t want to spring for the printer b the hp 612 is not better than homemade biscuits b  though i love this camera  there are some things that i don t like  they are not major things  but they are part of the package  the big thing for me is that digital has lag time  in other words  you push the button and then it drags for a split second  that means that it is hard to get action shots  kids are active  so i miss a lot i would want to capture and could capture with a 35 mm  i usually carry both a pocket 35 mm and this camera and get all i want with the two cameras  one nice thing about digital is that you have the lcd screen and can really look at the shot before you snap  but  the lcd is really hard to see when the sun is out  i find it better to use the regular viewfinder outside  when you use the lcd  you get a black flash up and know you took a picture  when you use the viewfinder  you press and don t hear a sound  you will wonder if you actually took the picture  i often shoot 2 or 3 thinking that i did not really make a picture  i don t catch this until i review on the lcd  which works great to see what you shot or put it up on the computer and look  on the plus side  i often get better pics when i have 2 or 3 shots  yes  this one does eat batteries  and so do all the digital cameras  i m used to 35 mm which will go on and on with the same batteries  it took me a while to learn to always carry extras  this is just part of the digital camera world right now  i hope that gets better  that covers the basics      b but  how about the options b  this camera does let you play around some  it does not have as many options as some  but it has as much as i would want  unless i could afford the professional level digital which i can t  you can push the button on the back and get the menu and make the selections and also on editing some with the photos on the spot  like you can dump a bad one  the book covers it well that you get with the camera  and i can use these options when i want to  off center focus is the one thing i use the most  i hate really flat photos  and this lets me make some changes with good results  box in on what you want to highlight  push the button to take pictures half way down  then all the way down  easy enough  the zoom 2x can be nice  be aware that zoom does not have the same quality that standard would have  it s better to walk in than to zoom in  the various flash options are good  it has fill flash and also off flash  the main one i use is the off when i don t want to light up a room  the software for photos is ok  the big thing is that you do not get a booklet to cover how to use that  i use software at work and can guess on most of that  they do have some directions that you can pull up on the computer  but it is still nice to have directions to hold in your hand and look at  one of my students who never used much software called the company and raised cain about that and got a free book to help her  i think i will borrow that  so i don t have to guess so much b do you want to spring for this camera b  if you want an easy digital camera that takes good pictures  then i would say this one is solid  you ll really want to add on with the other items that do run the price up but make life easier  to get the media card and the printer  i think it about double the price overall  so figure on  500 to do this  the batteries and charger will jack it up a bit more but save you money down the road  i m not going top rate on this one  because i don t think digital cameras have maxed out yet as far as being wonderful at home  i still fall back on my 35mm  but this hp is great for what it is and what it does  if i had to pick again  i would go with this one  ; the he is  good family camera it works as  point and shot for all the family teach idiot which includes most of the population but will do enough fancy stuff to keep the shutter navvy busy for  while if you want to focus other than center you can with this one you can room flash settings are adjustable including  shut off for those moments ruined by  photo flash bombs bursting in air but you don  have to worry about anything if you are

120;camera; there is lots to be said about the sony mavica fd85  first off this camera is very easy to use and what you do not understand the owners manual contains instructions which are very easy to read and understand  this camera is well worth the  500 just to have the floppy access which saves tons of time  you no longer have to connect your camera to a computer it is as simple as putting the floppy into your computer and all your pictures are there ready to be looked at  this feature is also great because you no longer have to take up precious hard drive space to store pictures with the low price of floppies you just store your disk for later viewing  as for picture quality it has 4 settings you can use and all are great quality for being a 1 3 megapixel in the lowest setting which is still great for viewing on a computer you can fit close to 35 pictures on each floppy which is great  the best feature on this camera definately is the battery life  even with the battery that comes with the camera has close to 2 hours of picture time which compared to all my other digital cameras that ran on aa batteries is unheard of to me and saves lots of money for a little extra money a 4 hour battery can be purchased and i definately will making this buy  the only real downsides to this camera i can say arent major at all 1 is the weight it is a little heavy but technology is heavy second thing is the lens cap gets in the way which is just a neucsence more than anything  well you heard my view on this camera and i am a regular person using this not a computer pro i hope this helps in your decision  thankyou for your time ; there is lots to be said about the sonya mavra ff first off this camera is very easy to use and what you do not understand the owners manual contains instructions which are very easy to read and understand this camera is well worth the just to have the floppy access which saves tons of time you no longer have to connect your camera to  computer it is as simple as putting the floppy into your computer and all your pictures are there ready to be looked at this feature is also great because you no longer have to take up precious hard drive space to store pictures with the low price of flopped you just store your disk for later viewing as for picture quality it has settings you can use and all are great quality for being  megapixel in the lowest setting which is still great for viewing on  computer you can fit close to pictures on each floppy which is great the best feature on this camera definitely is the battery life even with the battery that comes with the camera has close to hours of picture time which compared to all my other digital camera that ran on a batteries is unheard of to me and saves lots of money for  little extra money  hour battery can be purchased and  definitely will making this buy the only real downsides to this camera  can say agent major at all is the weight it is  little heavy but technology is heavy second thing is the lens cap gets in the way which is just  neucsence more than anything well you heard my view on this camera and  am  regular person using this not  computer pro  hope this helps in your decision thankyou for your time

123;camera; searching for a digital camera can be a nightmare  and i spent the last year trying to find a camera with all the features i wanted at a price i could afford  i have had a  beginner  digital camera for three years now  while it was high end when i got it  it is now  novice  level and was beginning to give up the ghost  it was time to invest in a new digital camera  and i knew exactly which features i wanted  unfortunately  these didn t coincide with my price range  until i found the  toshiba pdr m5    the toshiba pdr m5 is a megapixel digital camera  offering all of the features i wanted for a bargain pricetag  if you are shopping for a digital camera  i would suggest that you approach this scientifically  as the vast number of offerings can just overwhelm you when you start looking  also set out your price range   what you are willing to spend  and what you absolutely cannot go over  budget wise  my criteria  when i was shopping  included  megapixel   high resolution  zoom capability  2x minimum  usb connection  strongly preferred  menu driven  easy to use  fast processing  smartmedia card included  strongly preferred  ac cord included   rechargeable batteries  strongly preferred  all accessories included that i need  total price under  400  refurbished okay if warranted after looking at the features of dozens of different brand digital cameras  i was  quite frankly  overwhelmed and more than a little confused  it was hard enough to compare features within a brand  but comparing several cameras of different makes and models  almost impossible  there are so many different things to consider and minor variations  i finally made up my checklist  above  and started going through all of the options and suppliers  i ll describe the camera itself  then take you through my criteria and the specifications of the pdr m5 step by step here b physical appearance and features  the camera has a silver body  and measures about 5  wide x 3  high x 2 8  deep  and weighs only 11 3 oz  without the battery or smartmedia card  on the front there is the lens  which protrudes from the silver case  an optical viewfinder  and ergonomic grip with a rubber finger rest  on the top is a pop up flash  shutter button and the mode dial  on the back is the lcd display  a backlit data display  zoom controls  menu display macro delete buttons  a rocker button to navigate through the controls with  serves as an enter button also  and the flash timer and image quality control buttons  on the bottom are the battery compartment and the tripod adapter  on one side is the door for the smart media card  which locks shut  and on the other side is a rubberized flap that covers the usb connector  ac jack and ntsc out jack   mega pixel   high resolution  this camera has a 2 14 megapixel 1600 x 1200  or 800 x 600  resolution  i generally use it in the lowest  basic  mode  there are three  sizes  available and i found the 1600 x 1200 images to be far too huge  the image quality even at the lowest settings is fabulous  crisp and clear b zoom capability  this camera has a 3x optical zoom which is equivalent to a 38  115 mm lens  the zoom extends out when in use  and retracts back into the camera when not in use or the camera is turned off  there is also a 2x digital zoom feature  it is worth noting that the lens area sticks out from the rest of the camera all of the time  and is covered with a lens cover when not in use  one fun feature is a 2 5 playback zoom  which lets you look more closely at pictures in the playback mode b usb connection  this may be a petty point  but it was important to me personally  i have several little gizmos attached to my computer and hate kneeling down  trying to switch out the connection for my camera on the back of my computer when i need to change to another input  the usb cord is great  i can just leave it connected all of the time and plug it into my camera to download when needed b menu driven  it was important to me to be able to see  at a glance  exactly what the controls and settings were  i wanted an lcd display  standard on most digital cameras today  that made it very simple for me to set the camera and use it without a lot of squinting at tiny keys  trying to remember which combination to push together  etc  this camera s menu is great  there is a single button  clearly labeled  menu  that i push to bring up the menu  from my menu  i can control the record mode  all settings  self timer  lcd settings  image quality  flash mode  sounds  time  language  playback settings  etc  there are also several buttons that accomplish some of these features if you don t want to do this all on screen  however  i find it simple and easy to just scroll through the menus and select the options i want  and see them confirmed on screen b easy to use  in addition to being menu driven  i wanted a camera that wouldn t baffle me when i picked it up  bear in mind that i used to sell medical equipment  so i m not afraid of technical products  nonetheless  i like a camera i can pick up and understand in a matter of minutes  without spending hours reading manuals or having to read the manual four times just to figure out how to shoot a basic picture the pdr m5 has been outstanding in this area  it is clearly set up  with buttons clearly marked  the on screen displays and a mode dial on the top  the mode dial allows you to select whether you want manual mode  where you control the settings and focus  automatic  autofocus  off  playback or pc download mode  there is a detent at each option so it s easy to turn the dial to the correct setting  and a rubber bezel around the outside so it s easy to grip  there is also a little status display  a data lcd screen  right next to the optical viewfinder that is visible even when the image lcd display screen is off  this shows you the battery level  smart media card state  time  current picture settings and number of pictures remaining  i find myself referring to this all the time b fast processing  many people forget that toshiba is a computer company  and a relatively new entrant to the digital camera market  their first digital cameras were purchased and relabeled with the toshiba name  only with the pdr m4 did toshiba put their own electronics inside  the ultra fast processing speeds on the m5 reflect this  with what is called the  fastest consumer level digicam on the planet  it takes about 2 seconds to boot up at full resolution  and between  8 and 2 seconds between pictures  of course if you really needed faster pictures than that there is a burst mode available that gives you 4 to 16 shots per second b smart media card included   i wanted either a smart media card or floppy disk capability  with the media included in my price  the toshiba pdr m5 price includes a 8 mb smart media card  which allows me to take up to 128 pictures  at the lowest resolution  on one card  there is a 9 mb internal memory  however  this is only for buffering the pictures and there is no internal storage  which surprised me  but is fine now that i understand that  there is also a smart media card adapter that is optional  this lets you put the smart media card right into your floppy drive    ac cord and rechargeable batteries  one of the things that i disliked about my previous camera  the vivitar vivicam 2700  see my review at http research epinions com elec review 2b65 5b6730 38922400 prod4  was that it literally ate batteries  when the lcd screen was on it almost inhaled batteries  even off i could rarely get more than 30 40 images on a four pack of batteries  the pdr m5 has three answers to that dilemma  first is the inclusion of a 5v ac adapter  so you don t have to use your batteries for fixed image shooting and playback downloads  i had to order my adapter for the vivicam separately and it ran about  40  secondly  the battery is a rechargeable lithium  3 7v 1100mah liion  battery pack  included  that lets you take about 160 pictures with the viewfinder on  or 240 pictures with the lcd screen off  i ve never let it run all the way down  but it shows about half charged at 60 80 images left and i generally use the flash and the lcd screen  the battery recharges right in the camera in about five hours  if fully discharged  there is an optional external battery charger that is supposed to be far faster  one hour charging time  and for longer excursions i d recommend an extra battery pack as well  finally you can turn the lcd screen off and this will save power consumption as well b all accessories included that i need  after my experience with the vivicam  i wanted to be sure i didn t have to spend a lot of extra money  after  my purchase to complete my set  the pdr m5 came with everything i needed  although there are some optional accessories i am still considering  the camera ships with  camera  rechargeable lithium ion battery  ac power adapter  8 mb smart media card  shoulder hand strap  cd rom  instruction manual  warranty card  serial cables  ntsc video cables  usb cable and lens cap cover  the rebate form was downloaded from the toshiba website    extra features i didn t expect  as i said  this camera met my requirements  in addition  there were several other features that were above and beyond my requirements  and of course i m thrilled with them  although i haven t figured them all out  these include  lens cap cover   a lens cap cover that covers the  protruding  lens  it is attached by a strap to the camera so you don t lose it  movie capability   this camera has the capability of making short videos  without sound  this amazed me  at this price  the maximum size for any one movie is 8 mb  and time ranges from 30   120 seconds depending on the resolution required  the image quality is lower in movies  full size   320 x 240 and half size   160 x 120 pixels  but it s a fun feature and great to watch  black and white images   this was a surprising feature that i didn t even realize this camera had until i read the manual  i have many times that i d like to get a nice black and white photo  especially for corporate presentations or business use  the pdr m5 has an iso setting that lets you adjust the sensitivity from  the equivalent of iso  100 to 200 to 400 to black and white    burst multi image settings   in the burst mode  you can take 4 to 16 photos per second  these are not sent to the card but are stored in memory  after the burst you select which ones you want and store them to the smart media card  this is a nice mode for a moving object or for kids like mine  who smile and run  this way i can usually get at least one good picture  there is another mode called multiple images that lets you take 16 continuous shots  4 per second  all of the images are saved as one full sized image  this is nice for moving subjects  and my nephew used it to photograph a horse jumping  you cannot  however  use a flash on burst or multi photography  bulb mode   this is a long exposure mode for taking pictures that require several seconds to photograph  an example would be pictures of fireworks at night  you cannot use the flash for this mode either  you can adjust it from 1 second to 8 seconds open  self timer   a simple but nice feature allowing you to take pictures on a timer  you can set the timer for either a 2 second or 10 second delay  and can make movies with the timer as well  macro   a close up mode  allowing the camera to focus on subjects between 1 and 3 feet  normally subjects this close would be too close to focus on  but in the macro mode i can take pictures as close as 5 inches  such as of my kids  and have them be in focus  this is a really nice feature that i didn t expect to find on a camera in this price range  manual mode   if desired  you can set the camera to manual to adjust the white balance  exposure compensation  aperture value and af ae area  i have to admit that i don t know anything about these features and strongly prefer the automatic mode  but far more skilled photographers would no doubt appreciate this feature  ergonomic shape   the camera is more or less molded to your hand  so it is easy to grip  with rubber grips and a natural  right handed  shape that conforms to your hand  it is very lightweight and i find it far easier to hold than my previous digital camera and even my fixed pentax camera  digital zoom   allows the center of the image to be enlarged to twice its normal size  so you can more clearly see the image you are recording  this is nice for taking pictures of objects you know you may crop later  but want to select clearly now  playback zoom   this is a cool feature that allows you to frame in the area of a picture you want to see  then zoom in on that area during playback  this is great for seeing a small piece of an image that you want to see up close  such as a person s face in a distant shot  this is especially useful for burst photography where you are picking whether or not to save images  or if you are near the capacity of your card and want to decide if you should save or delete an image  3 mode display screen   the lcd screen actually has three options  the first is showing the image  with all of the photographic mode symbols  mode  number of shots left  flash  battery  time  date  etc  the second mode is to show the image without any symbols or mode information  and the third is with the screen off  the first two modes are also available during playback  i have found that the information is useful for my first picture than i find it distracting and turn it off    additional lens capability   this camera has an adapter ring attachment on the front  which is a threaded ring  if you wanted to  you could attach an additional lens or optical filter to your camera  red eye mode   the flash can be set in several modes  including automatic  red eye reduction  forced flash  suppressed flash and slow synchro  the slow synchro is good for shooting people at night with a dark background  or where there is a lot of backlighting  etc  white balance   in the manual mode  you can set the white balance  options include automatic adjustment  outdoors  bluish fluorescent light  reddish fluorescent light  and incandescent light  my cousin was quite excited to hear that i had these options  although i again admit i always leave the camera set to automatic b  what i m disappointed in   for the most part i am thrilled with this camera  to be fair  though  there are three things that are disappointing  although i ve learned to work with them  and you should be aware of when you select this camera  these are  shutter lag   there has to be a slight lag between when you hit the shutter and when you take the picture  this allows the camera to focus and then take the picture  if you don t allow for this lag  and just hit the shutter all the way  your images may be out of focus  i have learned to work with this but i must admit it s a pain when i have two little rugrats i m trying to photograph   that extra second it takes to focus can make the difference between having them smiling or not  or in the picture or having run off already  in any case you have to partially depress the button to focus before you fully depress the button to take the picture    off between record  amp  playback   whoever setup the mode dial clearly was more concerned about battery conservation than convenience  the camera has to cycle past  off  to get from  record  to  playback  which is a pain in the rear  i will admit that if you flip it really fast you can usually fool the camera  i like to see the image i just took before i decide if i need another one so i often flip back and forth  it s a minor inconvenience but not one i can t live with  low light focusing problems   the camera focuses optically  not using an infrared beam  i m not sure if this was to improve the processing speed or what  but it means that the camera has difficulty focusing in low light situations  i ve also had some minor problems with distance focusing  but not as bad  again these are not horrible issues  and perhaps if i had paid  800 for the camera i would be more upset  but it s a minor inconvenience  toshiba told me there is a firmware upgrade available but i don t have this yet b  price   the toshiba pdr m5 met all of my requirements  and was well within my price range  the retail price for a brand new pdr m5 is  799  but i have seen this on sale online for  599 and up  i bought mine through ubid for under  400  and there is a  100 mail in rebate as well  this brought my grand total to  296  including shipping   new or refurbished    my camera was refurbished  but with a 90 day warranty  which is long enough for me to determine if there is any major technical glitch with the camera  i have purchased many electronic items refurbished  and have found that new or refurbished  the average time to discover problems is about 2 3 weeks  if they pass this timeline  the next hurdle doesn t show up for over a year  which generally puts them outside the one year warranty anyway  i have purchased coffee makers  computers  monitors  cameras  and other electronic products refurbished without problems in the past  or  as i said  the problems clearly show up in the first 2 3 weeks of use  which is well within the initial warranty period  you  of course  have to decide how much risk you are willing to take for the savings involved b summary  after a year of searching  and watching cameras like the pdr m5 come on the market  but far above my price range  i didn t think i would ever find a camera that met my needs  i was shocked to see the pdr m5 on ubid  and spent several days researching this camera to make sure there weren t any major design flaws i was unaware of  reassured  i snatched up this gem at a bargain price  i have been incredibly impressed with the quality and delivery of this camera  and with its capabilities  i would recommend this to a friend who was shopping for a camera as a great buy  and hope that i will be using my pdr m5 for many years to come for more

nightmare and  spent the last year trying to find  camera with all the features  wanted at  price  could afford  have had  beginner digital camera for three years now while it was high end when  got it it is now novice level and was beginning to give up the ghost it was time to invest in  new digital camera and  knew exactly which features  wanted unfortunately these didn  coincide with my price range until  found the toshiba per  the toshiba per  is  megapixel digital camera offering all of the features  wanted for  bargain pricetag if you are shopping for  digital camera  would suggest that you approach this scientifically as the vast number of offerings can just overwhelm you when you start looking also set out your price range what you are willing to spend and what you absolutely cannot go over budget wise my criterion when  was shopping included megapixel high resolution room capability  minimum us connection strongly preferred menu driven easy to use fast processing smartmedia card included strongly preferred ac cord included rechargeable batteries strongly preferred all accessories included that  need total price under refurbished okay if warranted after looking at the features of dozens of different brand digital camera  was quite frankly overwhelmed and more than  little confused it was hard enough to compare features within  brand but comparing several camera of different makes and models almost impossible there are so many different things to consider and minor variations  finally made up my checklist above and started going through all of the option and suppliers  ll describe the camera itself then take you through my criterion and the specification of the per  step by step here  physical appearance and features the camera has  silver body and measures about wide  high  deep and weighs only oz without the battery or smartmedia card on the front there is the lens which protrudes from the silver case an optical viewfinder and economic grip with  rubber finger rest on the top is  pop up flash shutter button and the mode dial on the back is the led display  backlit data display room controls menu display micro delete buttons  rocket button to navigable through the controls with serves as an enter button also and the flash time and image quality control buttons on the bottom are the battery compartment and the tried adapted on one side is the door for the smart media card which locks shut and on the other side is  rubberized flap that covers the us connection ac jack and its out jack meg fixed high resolution this camera has  megapixel  or  resolution  generally use it in the lowest basic mode there are three sizes available and  found the  images to be far too huge the image quality even at the lowest settings is fabulous crisp and clear  room capability this camera has   optical room which is equivalent to  mm lens the room extends out when in use and retracts back into the camera when not in use or the camera is turned off there is also   digital room feature it is worth noting that the lens area sticks out from the rest of the camera all of the time and is covered with  lens cover when not in use one fun feature is  playback room which lets you look more closely at pictures in the playback mode  us connection this may be  petty point but it was important to me personally  have several little gizmos attached to my computer and hate kneeling down trying to switch out the connection for my camera on the back of my computer when  need to change to another input the us cord is great  can just leave it connected all of the time and plug it into my camera to download when needed  menu driven it was important to me to be able to see at  glance exactly what the controls and settings were  wanted an led display standard on most digital camera today that made it very simple for me to set the camera and use it without  lot of squatting at tiny keys trying to remember which combination to push together etc this camera  menu is great there is  single button clearly labelled menu that  push to bring up the menu from my menu  can control the record mode all settings self time led settings image quality flash mode sounds time language playback settings etc there are also several buttons that accomplish some of these features if you don  want to do this all on screen however  find it simple and easy to just stroll through the venus and select the option  want and see them confirmed on screen  easy to use in addition to being menu driven  wanted  camera that wouldn  baffled me when  picked it up bear in mind that  used to sell medical equipment so   not afraid of technical products nonetheless  like  camera  can pick up and understand in  matter of minutes without spending hours reading manual or having to read the manual four times just to figure out how to shoot  basic picture the per  has been outstanding in this area it is clearly set up with buttons clearly marked the on screen displays and  mode dial on the top the mode dial allows you to select whether you want manual mode where you control the settings and focus automatic autofocus off playback or pp download mode there is  decent at each option so it  easy to turn the dial to the correct setting and  rubber been around the outside so it  easy to grip there is also  little status display  data led screen right next to the optical viewfinder that is visible even when the image led display screen is off this shows you the battery level smart media card state time current picture settings and number of pictures remaining  find myself referring to this all the time  fast processing many people forget that toshiba is  computer company and  relatively new entrance to the digital camera market their first digital camera were purchased and relabeled with the toshiba name only with the per  did toshiba put their own electronics inside the ultra fast processing speed on the  reflect this with what is called the fattest consumer level digital on the planet it takes about seconds to boot up at full resolution and between and seconds between pictures of course if you really needed faster pictures than that there is  burst mode available that gives you to shots per second  smart media card included  wanted either  smart media card or floppy disk capability with the media included in my price the toshiba per  price includes  mb smart media card which allows me to take up to pictures at the lowest resolution on one card there is  mb internal memory however this is only for suffering the pictures and there is no internal storage which surprised me but is fine now that  understand that there is also  smart media card adapted that is optional this lets you put the smart media card right into your floppy drive ac cord and rechargeable batteries one of the things that  disliked about my previous camera the visitor vivicam see my review at http research opinions com elect review   proud was that it literally ate batteries when the led screen was on it almost inhaled batteries even off  could rarely get more than images on  four pack of batteries the per  has three answers to that dilemma first is the inclusion of   ac adapted so you don  have to use your batteries for fixed image shooting and playback download  had to order my adapted for the vivicam separately and it ran about secondly the battery is  rechargeable lithium  may lion battery pack included that lets you take about pictures with the viewfinder on or pictures with the led screen off  ve never let it run all the way down but it shows about half charged at images left and  generally use the flash and the led screen the battery charges right in the camera in about five hours if fully discharged there is an optional external battery charge that is supposed to be far faster one hour charging time and for longer excursions   recommend an extra battery pack as well finally you can turn the led screen off and this will save power consumption as well  all accessories included that  need after my experience with the vivicam  wanted to be sure  didn  have to spend  lot of extra money after my purchase to complete my set the per  came with everything  needed although there are some optional accessories  am still considering the camera ships with camera rechargeable lithium ion battery ac power adapted mb smart media card shoulder hand strap d from instruction manual warranty card aerial tables its video tables us cable and lens cap cover the debate form was download from the toshiba webster extra features  didn  expect as  said this camera met my requirements in addition there were several other features that were above and beyond my requirements and of course   thrilled with them although  haven  figured them all out these include lens cap cover  lens cap cover that covers the protruding lens it is attached by  strap to the camera so you don  lose it movie capability this camera has the capability of making short video without sound this amazed me at this price the maximum size for any one movie is mb and time ranges from seconds depending on the resolution required the image quality is lower in moves full size  and half size  pipes but it   fun feature and great to watch black and white images this was  surprising feature that  didn  even realize this camera had until  read the manual  have many times that   like to get  nice black and white photo especially for corporate presentations or business use the per  has an iso setting that lets you adjust the sensitivity from the equivalent of iso to to to black and white burst multi image settings in the burst mode you can take to photo per second these are not sent to the card but are stored in memory after the burst you select which ones you want and store them to the smart media card this is  nice mode for  moving object or for kiss like mine who smile and run this way  can usually get at least one good picture there is another mode called multiple images that lets you take continuous shots per second all of the images are saved as one full sized image this is nice for moving subjects and my nephew used it to photograph  horse jumping you cannot however use  flash on burst or multi photography bulb mode this is  long exposure mode for taking pictures that require several seconds to photograph an example would be pictures of fireworks at night you cannot use the flash for this mode either you can adjust it from second to seconds open self time  simple but nice feature allowing you to take pictures on  time you can set the time for either  second or second delay and can make moves with the time as well micro  close up mode allowing the camera to focus on subjects between and feet normally subjects this close would be too close to focus on but in the micro mode  can take pictures as close as inches such as of my kiss and have them be in focus this is  really nice feature that  didn  expect to find on  camera in this price range manual mode if desired you can set the camera to manual to adjust the white balance exposure compensation aperture value and of a area  have to admit that  don  know anything about these features and strongly prefer the automatic mode but far more skilled photographer would no doubt appreciate this feature economic shape the camera is more or less molded to your hand so it is easy to grip with rubber grip and  natural right handed shape that conforms to your hand it is very lightweight and  find it far easier to hold than my previous digital camera and even my fixed mental camera digital room allows the center of the image to be enlarged to twice its normal size so you can more clearly see the image you are recording this is nice for taking pictures of objects you know you may crop later but want to select clearly now playback room this is  cool feature that allows you to frame in the area of  picture you want to see then room in on that area during playback this is great for seeing  small piece of an image that you want to see up close such as  person  face in  distant shot this is especially useful for burst photography where you are picking whether or not to save images or if you are near the capacity of your card and want to decide if you should save or delete an image mode display screen the led screen actually has three option the first is showing the image with all of the photographic mode symbols mode number of shots left flash battery time date etc the second mode is to show the image without any symbols or mode information and the third is with the screen off the first two modes are also available during playback  have found that the information is useful for my first picture than  find it distracting and turn it off additional lens capability this camera has an adapted ring attachment on the front which is  treated ring if you wanted to you could attach an additional lens or optical filter to your camera red eye mode the flash can be set in several modes including automatic red eye reduction forced flash suppressed flash and slow synchro the slow synchro is good for shooting people at night with  dark background or where there is  lot of backlighting etc white balance in the manual mode you can set the white balance option include automatic adjustment outdoor bluish fluorescent light reddish fluorescent light and incandescent light my cousin was quite excited to hear that  had these option although  again admit  always leave the camera set to automatic  what   disappointed in for the most part  am thrilled with this camera to be fair though there are three things that are disappointing although  ve learned to work with them and you should be aware of when you select this camera these are shutter law there has to be  slight law between when you hit the shutter and when you take the picture this allows the camera to focus and then take the picture if you don  allow for this law and just hit the shutter all the way your images may be out of focus  have learned to work with this but  must admit it   pain when  have two little regrets   trying to photograph that extra second it takes to focus can make the difference between having them smiling or not or in the picture or having run off already in any case you have to partially depress the button to focus before you fully depress the button to take the picture off between record amp playback whoever set the mode dial clearly was more concerned about battery conservation than convenience the camera has to cycle past off to get from record to playback which is  pain in the rear  will admit that if you lip it really fast you can usually fool the camera  like to see the image  just took before  decide if  need another one so  often lip back and forth it   minor inconvenience but not one  can  live with low light rousing problems the camera focused optical not using an inflamed beam   not sure if this was to improve the processing speed or what but it means that the camera has difficulty rousing in low light situations  ve also had some minor problems with distance rousing but not as bad again these are not horrible issues and perhaps if  had paid for the camera  would be more upset but it   minor inconvenience toshiba told me there is  firmware upgrade available but  don  have this yet  price the toshiba per  met all of my requirements and was well within my price range the retail price for  brand new per  is but  have seen this on sale online for and up  bought mine through bid for under and there is  mail in debate as well this brought my grand total to including shipping new or refurbished my camera was refurbished but with  day warranty which is long enough for me to determine if there is any major technical pitch with the camera  have purchased many electronic items refurbished and have found that new or refurbished the average time to discover problems is about weeks if they pass this timeline the next hardly doesn  show up for over  year which generally puts them outside the one year warranty anyway  have purchased coffee makers computers monitor camera and other electronic products refurbished without problems in the past or as  said the problems clearly show up in the first weeks of use which is well within the initial warranty period you of course have to decide how much risk you are willing to take for the savings involved  summary after  year of searching and watching camera like the per  come on the market but far above my price range  didn  think  would ever find  camera that met my needs  was shocked to see the per  on bid and spent several days searching this camera to make sure there weren  any major design flaws  was unaware of reassured  snatched up this gem at  bargain price  have been incredibly impressed with the quality and delivery of this camera and with its capabilities  would recommend this to  friend who was shopping for  camera as  great buy and hope that  will be using my per  for many years to come for more information on the toshiba per  click on the manufacturer  link above very top left under quit reviewed item quit or on

126;auto; i first saw what was to become the xg 300 at the philadelphia auto show in 1999  it was then called the equus  i looked curiously at this large  for a hyundai  car sitting on the platform and was disappointed that it was for show only  you could not sit in it  the next year  it had changed names and was available for inspection  i was immediately impressed with the long list of standard features and the sticker price just knocked me out  this year  with the 0  financing  i decided to take a test drive  i am glad that i did  it turned me on to an incredible value  that i am appreciating more with each day i drive it  front and side air bags  traction control  pre tensor seat belts   they tighten to hold you against the seat in a collision  and 4 wheel abs disc brakes make safety one of the big reasons i bought this car  these are standard yet some of these items are not even offered on other makes in this price range  the 5 speed automatic transmission is the smoothest shifting one i have ever had the pleasure to drive  slip it into the  manual  gate and you can control the shift points to give a sportier feel  even in the  manual  gate  however  you cannot overrev the engine or upshift to too high a gear to make the engine drag  as it is electronically blocked  shifts while cornering while in  d  come a bit late  so if you like to push it through the corner a bit  you will definitely need to use the manual gate  the engine itself is extremely quiet during normal acceleration and cruising  even at 70 mph  but exhibits a slight growl under hard acceleration  not at all unpleasant  though  this certainly is not the fastest car on the block  but it is more than adequate for most drivers  the flip side to that is that gas mileage is pretty good for a car of this size  i am averaging in the low to mid 20 s in suburban driving  the 2002 will have a 3 5 liter 194 hp engine upgrade  ride quality is more to the highway cruiser type  hardly a pothole or bump will jar you  handling is a bit mushy due to this  comparable to my chrysler town   country minivan  the complaint about the  little  wheels has been rectified  as the xg300 now comes with standard 16  wheels  michelin tires  i have read some of the other reviews here  and wonder if these people have actually driven the car  one complained of  tight head room with the moon roof  i am 6 5  and usually have trouble fitting into cars of asian descent  this is the only one i have sat in with a moon roof that i can actually fit in with no problems  my head does not touch the roof liner even with the moon roof liner closed  leg room is adequate for me  and someone can actually sit behind me in the back seat  the 6 way adjustable power seat is very comfortable  but lacks enough lateral support for hard cornering  the leather is nice and smells good to me   i don t know where they got the  plastic fumes  from  in fact the interior in general is well put together  the trip computer is kind of useless  giving miles until empty and miles driven as the only useful information  i don t really care about average miles per hour or elapsed time  and would have appreciated gas mileage readings  not included  the miles driven is redundant with the trip odometer on the dash  climate control is very nice  keeping the car either warm or cool accurately  but somewhat confusing to use  air can be fresh or recycled or automatically determined by computer  the confusing part  if fumes are present  i still haven t quite figured out what that means  passenger seat is 4 way power adjustable and both seats are heated   standard on  l  which with leather in a cold climate you really do need  they get very cold to sit on  the  mist  button on the end of the wiper stalk is a nice touch that allows one sweep of the windshield during light rain  the driver power seat will fully retract when the engine is turned off to allow easy entrance and exit  and return to the previous setting upon starting the car  there are 2 presets for the seat and mirrors available   on  l  version this is standard  electrochromic rearview mirror is standard  automatically adjusts for day night electronically  i probably missed some items  but the list is very long  i bought the xg300l version and most everything is standard  with moon roof  heated seats and a long list of standard items on the  l  plus every option available  wind shield for moon roof  cargo net  8 cd changer  and pin stripping the car listed for around  27 000  i paid  23 500 with 0  financing for 5 years  for  660  i got the extended warranty for 10 year  100 000 mile bumper to bumper coverage   usually 5 year  60 000 mile  which is then also transferable to a new owner  you cannot come close to matching that with any other car  i think it is a nice looking car  but that is subjective to each person  and the quality seems to be there so far  i am extremely impressed the fit and finish at this point  i highly

145;auto; i purchased this car about 8 months ago and must say i am totally pleased with it  i had a 2000 honda civic ex before but needed something with 4 doors and having the rear hatch sold me on the spectra  with the rear seats folded down there is plenty of room for cargo  i am not here to bash the civic but i have to say that overall the kia outperforms the civic easily  that might be hard for some of you to believe but seriously drive a civic and then compare a spectra  the one thing that impresses me the most about the spectra over the civic is its ease to drive  with the honda i had to rev the heck out of the car to extract any type of decent speed  with the kia and the close gear ratios of the 5 spd transaxle you can drive moderate and still achieve excellent acceleration  i just got tired of having to drive the civic so hard around town  the way the spectra handles is another strong point  with a lotus tuned suspension and front and rear anti sway bars  the spectra remains composed and stable in corners  the only minus i can find is the tires which just don t have enough traction and side stability for me  in fairness though i had the same issue with the honda and after replacing the firestones with yokohamas it totally changed the manners of that car  and i suspect the same with the kia  the brakes work very well with no fade after several hard stops  my spectra does not have anti lock brakes and so far i have not locked any of the wheels in hard braking inside the spectra is quite comfortable for this class of car  the seats are so much better than the civic  i used to hate to take the honda on long trips because of its hard flat seats and the material after 6 months started wearing out on the civic  the seat material and cushioning is definately higher quality on the kia  the dashboard on the spectra is attractive and easy to see  all the controls are easy to get to  the only places that kia skimped some seem to be the plastic door panels and the headliner and carpet seem on the cheap side but hey this is a under  11 000 car one other thing to point out if you like doing your own engine service is that the 1 8l engine is quite easy to work on  i have changed the oil and filter and didn t even need a filter wrench to remove the old filter  just reached down behind the engine and spun it off by hand  everything else is pretty easy to get to as well overall i must say that this is a great little car and as far as some of the other reviewers have said about kia s reliability as they get older  take a look on the road and see how many ford festiva s and ford aspires  both made by kia for ford  and you may be surprised  most of those cars are over 10 years old and still run great  i have known several people with them that say they are very happy  ;

151;auto; ok this review may not be all that great  but worthwhile decent  i bought this car around december of 1999 from an arabian individual  it was salvaged with 88 000 miles  at the time i didn t know what salvaged meant when i saw it on the dmv papers  then when the insurance explained the disadvantage of it  i was in serious anxiety  i bought this car for 5 800  where it was listed for 6500  but made a bargain  and where did i get that kind of money  from totalling my mother s 94 nissan sentra and i was at fault  anyhow  how is this mazda salvaged  the owner said it used to be stolen with the leather stripped and driver door broken and was hotwired  that s all the retailer said  i bought it anyway  smart move huh  for some time problems occured  i had a rebuilt transmission which killed  2 500 out of me the most and has caused drama  i had rebuilt front left and right drive axles costing half a thousand dollars  rear sway bar left link replacement which less than a couple hundred  two and a half years later i had an engine oil leak  cuz my dumb self was using valvoline high mileage oil and was kinda overfilling the oil  and that was 400 bucks  sooner or later i had a coolant leak  it was probably a sign to change my timing belt and water pump  so therefore i had my timing belt and water pump service after noticing coolant leakage  then another problem days later after the service  except this will shock you  my car just died out on the freeway at 65 75mph with the dash lights litted on and the hold light blinking  kinda difficult to start the car after pulling to the side off the pavement  but gave it a couple of minutes resting and got it running again  this happend to me three times  so took it in for service and they recommend new spark plugs  air filter  distributor and rotor cap  and they say i went 3000 miles over since my last oil change  and transmission fluid was red than usual so they drained and filled fluid at the time which was right every 30 000 miles and i believe its been 24 30 thousand miles after getting the rebuilt transmission  for a whopping  2400  so i brought it to be serviced again  then i got the car back  and it died again on the freeway    its such a disgrace for a new looking car to do that  so as of today  5 6 02  my car is in the shop again  but free diagnose of the engine problem but now they re making me pay a diagnose fee of the hold light coming on as a sign of a transmission problem and i have just had a rebuilt trans 2 years ago and its probably been just 24 30 thousand miles on it  everything shifts fine and all i just don t wanna pay another    2500 again  ahhhhhh damn mazda to hell is this car japanese or american  when you start the ignition on a honda  acura  nissan  lexus  toyota  mitsu  and so on  except on a mazda  dont their startup  rythm seem to sound alike  the rhythm is slow  on a mazda it sounds like an american starter  where the rythm sounds fast  i noticed that the ford probe is exact to a mazda 626 or mx6  can anyone tell me if this car is actually a ford  i saw a ford commercial and like other brand logos appeared which means its made by ford  even mazda  and is ford reliable in some ways or not  also  my friend also owned a v6 626 but 2 years newer  and her car had problems too  except not as much as i have  she has had timing belt and water pump service already  and now she has to worry about the axle boots and axles which went out after having the water pump and timing belt service  fortunately  her car was in new condition with a clean history title  but she dislikes it and she has already traded it in i don t understand why they permit salvaged cars to sell  don t they know that insurance won t cover a salvaged car fully  they should just keep the car at the junkyard for dismantling the parts to replace other parts and thats it nothing more nothing less i also have doubts that anyone will buy this car  i have close to 3 500 of repairs done from bringing the car into the dealership from day one  would anyone buy it for 6 900 for the sake of goodwill and charity  i would encourage slow steady careful local drivers to think about it  i do need the money  it just sucks how this scarlet letter a salvaged title makes it cursed  if i ever get it sold for enough or if pick and pull buys it for a decent amount  i ll put that money as a down payment on a used but reliable japan import car  and if i ever get a job  make monthly payments on a loan as well to the car i wished i have done this type of research with used car reliability guides and epinions in the first place  but now its too late but now i know  do not get a mazda  even if you a racer enthusiast going for the rx 7  get rid of it and get a true japanese car  like acura or honda  toyota or lexus  and infiniti or nissan  mazda is ford  and f o r d   found on the road dead ;

156;camera; i am not new to digital cameras and  in a way i feel better equipped to explore the features of this camera now that i ve used another one extensively  let me state right off the bat that if you aren t willing to give the manual a fair perusal  then this is probably not going to be a good camera for you my entry into the world of digital cameras came through an agfa e780 camera  while this was an excellent introductory camera  it lacked zoom capabilities and the picture quality peaked out at 3 x 5 photos  i loved my little agfa  don t get me wrong  it s just that i feel i have grown up now and i want a toy with more bells and whistles  the olympus d 490 was the perfect  next step  for me one of the reasons i chose this camera over others was the price to features ratio  in my opinion  the olympus d 490 offers features comparable to some of the higher end cameras without the higher end price tag feature highlights  not an all inclusive list b 1 8 inch color lcd monitor  the monitor on this camera is very sharp  the display is crystal clear and it is very easy to determine if you ve gotten the shot you wanted  while most digital cameras have an lcd screen these days  not all screens are created equal  the clarity on this one is one of the better ones i ve seen b 2 11 megapixel ccd for photo quality output  the higher megapixel allows for larger high resolution pictures  i have taken a couple of really nice landscape shots  printed them at 8 x 10 on my inkjet printer  framed them and hung them on the wall  i am exceptionally pleased with the quality  even up close there is very little  almost none  graininess to be seen b 3x optical zoom with 2 5x digital zoom  this is one of the main features for which i bought the camera  the 3x optical zoom is perfect for scooting in on the squirrel in the yard or moving out to take in the  big  picture  i haven t used the digital zoom much as it requires switching from the optical viewer to the lcd  i just don t care to take pictures that way and i find that extra step not worth the effort  the picture quality degrades only slightly when using the digital zoom  so it is handy to have when you need it  but for the most part  the optical zoom is really quite adequate b sequential shooting capability  this is a fun feature that allows you take a series of quick pictures without waiting for the camera to write them to the memory card  i haven t used this feature much  but it s pretty good for photographing and active child or pet  out of the series  you are bound to get one good shot b manual iso settings  being an extreme amateur  this is not a feature that i ve played with much  i do understand the different iso settings  auto  100  200  and 400  but i haven t found any reason to want to switch from auto since the camera seems very adept at determining available light and adjusting appropriately   quicktimetm movie mode  this is one of my favorite features  while stills are super  there is nothing more fun than being able to send a short film to grandma showing the kiddies blowing bubbles or falling in the snow  the manual says that the camera is capable of filming up to 15 seconds  on the included 8mb memory card  but i often find that a 6 or 7 second video is all i really want to capture a moment b self timer with 12 second delay   this is another feature i don t use often  but i have used it and it is handy at times when i decide to come out from behind the shutter  i really prefer to be behind the scenes documenting everything  but once in awhile i set the camera on top of the tv and jump in the picture another  pro  in my opinion  that seems to be  con  with others  is the fact that this camera uses the serial port for connection to the computer  i know usb is faster  a usb cable is available for this camera  but doesn t come with it  from now until 5 31 01  olympus is offering a usb smartmedia reader for free with proof of purchase  however  i have an older pc and it did not come with usb capabilities  i don t have a usb port  i know i could upgrade  and i probably will someday  but i don t care to be forced into it  this camera came with a serial port cable that plugs into the camera for picture transfer  it s slow  but it works and i m content with it the camera came with an 8mb smartmedia card and long lasting lithium batteries  the batteries are great  but i wish they were rechargeable  i have more in the wings  though  that are  the 8mb smartmedia card is okay  but not great  i have two other 8mb cards  though so i can generally get all the pictures i want on a day s outing  i d need more  though  if i were going to be out where i couldn t download  of course  there is always the option to use a lesser resolution  but that would defeat the purpose of having a megapixel camera in the first place overall  my favorite part about this camera is the handling  an hour with the manual greatly improved my ability to manipulate the features and navigate through the menus  the menu options vary depending on whether the camera is off or on and i still get confused sometimes when looking for a specific option i would not recommend this camera to a digital beginner  i think it would be daunting and frustrating  my husband  a digital beginner  would concur  i love it  though  and it makes me feel like getting out and taking pictures  this camera is ready to use right out of the box but until you ve read the manual  you will miss a lot that this camera has to offer b how it compares  back to my little agfa 1 being a 1 megapixel camera  the agfa had a higher yield on the 8mb card  this 2 megapixel tiger eats up media space  naturally 2 the flash was slow to warm up on the agfa  this flash is ready to use the moment you open the flash housing  which has to be done manually 3 the agfa had a fixed focus and fixed iso setting  great for general purpose use  but i do enjoy the flexibility of the auto iso and zoom capabilities of the olympus 4 both cameras offered serial port connection with optional s video port for tv display  no change there 5 the agfa shut itself off eventually once it sensed it was being ignored  the olympus has that capability but you don t realize it until you get into the software to set the camera settings  it even has variable settings  good feature 6 the optical viewer on the agfa was centered on the body  this caused you to place your nose print prominently on the lcd screen  ugly smear  the olympus is offset to the left and is much cleaner to use 7 the olympus also offers and adjustment on the optical viewer to better align the view with the lens  in case you keep cutting uncle harold s head off overall  i am proud to have traded up to my olympus  i am thoroughly pleased with camera as a whole and my only objection was the size of smartmedia card they chose to send with it  compared to the 2mb card that came with the agfa  though  i suppose i m not too disappointed a final note others have complained about the way the camera closes and turns off  in order to close the camera  you have to slide the lens door toward the lens almost but not quite touching  the lens will then retract and you can finish closing the door  it is a little awkward at first  but it is really not as bad as all that  however  my husband  who works second shift  did wake me up in the middle of the night the first night we had the camera  he had opened it but couldn t figure out how to close it i feel like i am probably forgetting something major  this camera is so feature packed and versatile that it is impossible to cover everything here  that s why they enclose a 140 page manual  while it might not be the  choice of the pros  and it might be a bit challenging to the beginner  is it certainly ample camera for this intermediate level user  i love it and i m proud to have it for examples of some of the pics taken with this camera  go to http community webshots com

160;auto; before i get into my review of my 1994 chevrolet astro  i feel the need to say that i love this van  in all seriousness  it has probably been the smartest purchase of my life  it has faithfully served myself and my four boys for seven years and over 160 000 miles  and continues to give me everything i ask for in a car with the same quality it did when it rolled off the dealer s lot i purchased the van in late 1994  as a dealer closeout at a rock bottom price  for the premium lt  luxury touring  model on the extended body and all wheel drive  it was mine for about  24 000  a little bit expensive  but when i looked down the street at the dodge grand caravan  a more car like and more stylish model  i found that for a premium trim  comparable equipment  with all wheel drive  the sticker ran well over  30 000  it seemed like a no brainer to me what the smarter deal was  i gave up the more car like temperament of the grand caravan but kept  6000  in my pocket  although it s not as stylish looking as the chrysler built minivans  its strengths lie in other areas  one of these such areas is the powertrain  4 3 liters of high output v 6 engine serve up 200 horsepower and over 250 pound feet of torque  this translates into smooth around town acceleration as well as easy highway merging and two lane passing  the four speed automatic transmission with overdrive is a perfect match for the engine  with it s crisp shifts and an overdrive gear for quiet highway cruising  the fabulous all wheel drive system has never left me stranded in snow  sleet and ice and provides a notable advantage in handling and balance on dry roads the astro is a body on frame van  which means that its bodywork is bolted to a full steel ladder frame  this is good for towing   don t ask me why  but i do know that the astro is rated to pull over 5000 lbs  compare that to a maximum of 3 800 lbs  for chrysler minivans  the exceptionally spacious interior is also well suited to highway cruising  with it s comfortable seats   especially with lt trim  standard seating is two front captain s chairs  power on the driver s side  with adjustable lumbar supports and headrests  my particular van came with second  and third row split folding bench seats that have folding center armrests and outboard headrests  although they are a little on the heavier side  these bench seats are easily removable to open up 170 cubic feet of cargo space the one thing i cannot emphasize enough is the durability of this minivan  160 000 miles later  and with only normal periodic maintenance  it still functions as it did the day i bought it  the body is in perfect condition  i only wash it about twice a month and wax it about twice a year  and the paint still has a glossy shine to it  the interior has taken the abuse my four boys and i have dished out to it in stride   the scotchgard treated cloth seats and carpet resist stains surprisingly well  and the seat cloth shows no wear spots  the suspension has never needed any repairs save for one set of leaf springs  considering the amount of loading and towing i do  this is nothing short of a miracle  and still provides a comfortable ride  the engine starts up with absolutely no hesitation  even on a below zero morning  runs smoothly  quietly and without complaint  and most importantly  has never failed me   something i cannot say about my 1995 voyager   read my review and you ll know what i m talking about however  even i have to admit that this van has it s pitfalls  nothing in life comes without a price  and the price that comes with this van is the lousy gas mileage  i have consistently averaged between 16 and 17 mpg with this vehicle  this is no doubt attributable to the large displacement  for a v 6  truck engine and the all wheel drive system  the control panel also leaves a lot to be desired  the first generation instrument panel of the astro placed climate controls to the immediate right of the gauge cluster  which curiously includes a voltmeter and oil pressure gauge but not a tachometer  and the sound system in the dead center of the dashboard  this is inconvenient for two reasons   1  the front passenger cannot comfortably reach the climate controls  and 2  the driver cannot comfortably reach the sound system  in 1996  chevrolet updated the astro  to include a new dashboard layout which features easy to use rotary climate control knobs and new delco sound systems  the final downfall of this vehicle is the substandard crash test scores  nhtsa rated the 1994 astro as three stars  average  for the driver and one star  very poor  for the front passenger in their front impact test  the insurance institute for highway safety also dealt the astro a sickening blow with its 1996 40 mph offset crash test  which produced extremely poor results  to see the results of this test  visit the following url  http www hwysafety org vehicle ratings ce html 96024 htm  although this test was conducted on a dual airbag equipped astro  the offset crash test is more demanding on the structure of the car rather than the restraint systems  so the results of the 1996 test are largely applicable to earlier models  the lack of a front passenger airbag  a standard feature on grand caravan and town   country  certainly did not help this along at all  a passenger airbag was added in 1996 along with the aforementioned redesigned dashboard  as i have never been in an accident with this van  knocking on wood here  however  i cannot attest to the real world crashworthiness of this vehicle  prospective buyers should note  however  that grand caravan received four stars  enough to earn a  good  rating  for both the driver and front passenger in 1994 regardless of the vehicle s flaws  it has done a commendable job of transporting my family and i see no signs of it ceasing to operate anytime in the near future  when it does  however  i ll be back at my chevy dealer  looking for a new astro  i recently drove my friend s  02 astro lt  and i noticed all the positive attributes of my workhorse as well as some new features i would enjoy  as a final word  i think it goes without saying that this van has certainly lived up to my expectations  and i would certainly recommend it to anyone searching for a functional  spacious  capable minivan  update  1 6 2004   dad  come out and look that was one of my 16 year old twins  pulling into the driveway after work the other day  i went to the front door and he was standing by the astro  with its driver s door open  puzzled  i went over to where he was standing and looked into the vehicle  i didn t notice anything out of the ordinary  i gave him a strange look  and he pointed to the instrument cluster  this time  i took notice  the mechanical odometer indicated that the van had been driven exactly 250 000 miles  wow  it is a small feat that the van has even made it this far  but it is nothing short of a miracle that it has done so with little more than routine maintenance  i still change the oil every 3 000 miles  which happens about once a month  with maxlife synthetic oil  the transmission gets flushed every 25 000  which is about twice a year i would prefer every 12 000  but at  99 a pop  my wallet prefers otherwise  and i add a can of restore at every other oil change  i started using restore at about 185 000 miles  and the car literally feels like new again  my nephew  who is my mechanic of choice  dropped the car off at my house after installing new brakes  practically gushing at how well the van runs  even though the van now serves mostly around town duty  like grocery store runs and my kids driving back and forth to school  i have no doubt that i could hop in and drive across the state  or even across the country  with no problems  this van has certainly earned its place in my garage  long live the astro  ; before  get into my review of my chevrolet gastro  feel the need to say that  love this van

165;camera; i recently received the kodak dc215 as an early christmas gift  so i can t complain as a buyer  as i didn t actually pay for it    i know that in atlanta  the going retail rate in the stores is still hovering around  299 for this camera  but the person who purchased it for me found it at of all places  wal mart  at  249  after having used this camera a bit longer  i ve edited my opinion  as seen below  for the good  bad  and misc edited epinion   12 10 00  it s longer  take a deep breath b the good b the kodak dc 215 is in fact  has a very solid feel to it  due to it s metal body  a nice change compared to today s mostly plastic bodies on other digital cameras costing even more  it has a nice feel to it  and a simple   quot square ish quot  body  with a rubber grip on the end for holding comfort  the lcd display is on top of the camera and is easily readable  with four buttons to the right   the larger being the shutter  photo  button  and three smaller buttons to control flash settings  macro  close up  mode  and a self timer  on the back are the color viewer  power  zoom control  settings control  and selection buttons  all are very intuitive  and easy to figure out  even without the manual  the color viewer is slightly recessed  unlike many cameras where it sticks out from the camera body  making it harder to scratch  there is also an optical viewfinder you may use  to conserve batter life  color viewers take a lot of battery power from your camera  which is located up and to the left of the color viewer  nice   you won t leave nose prints on the color view screen  lt g gt a quick note   the documentation for the dc 215 is also excellent  especially for beginners  a clearly and easy to read manual is included  and even my roommate  a techno phobe  could understand it it s nice to find an  optical  zoom on a camera of this price range  instead of a less detailed  digital  zoom  still  if you re new to digital cameras  you should note that a 2x optical zoom is only equal to a slightly closer than  quot real vision view quot  in other words  2x is not technically a  quot zoom quot    3x and above are truly  quot zooms quot  that get you noticeably closer to the object s  to be photographed than your normal vision would see  still  again  a 2x optical is nice for this price range photo quality is a mixed bag  depending on the environment  i ve found that indoor photos with the flash and without  during day hours with natural sunlight in the rooms  turn out pretty nice overall  the flash does tend to flatten out colors slightly  but not enough to make the photos turn out horrible  for the most part  colors are rich and detail is pretty good  the various quality settings  talked about below more  allow you to adjust the camera for better quality indoor photos as well  with a greater range of quality settings than found on some other cameras b the bad b outdoor photos are somewhat more of a disappointment with the dc 215  outside  photos are fine when your subject is within 12 15 feet of you  however  the dc 215 s fixed focus lens is not able to capture great details on distant objects  such as landscapes  mountains  trees  etc  only an auto focus lens found on other camera  usually costing more  will provide that detail  in other words  the dc 215 is great for casual photos of the pets  kids  or get togethers  but i might not pick it for those cherished scenic shops of your vacation in europe  if you re lucky enough to get  quot paint shop pro 7 quot  then you ll find that you can increase the image quality of many of your photos  however my largest disappointment with the dc 215 is the very flimsy door that you flip open in order to retrieve the compact flash storage card  i feel this is going to be the first part of the camera to break for many folks  especially if you re a guy with big fingers    the small button you must swivel up and push in  in order to eject the flash card  is equally frail  i ll take points off for these two features   kodak should have done a better quality job on these parts b misc b the standard silver dc 215 edition camera comes with a 4 meg compact flash card  this may or may not allow you to store a lot of photos  depending on your settings  so  you may wish to invest in another larger storage card  for example  if you wish to print your photos  then you ll want to set your camera for  quot best quot  resolution  1154 x 864 pixel size  and  quot best quot  quality  which will then only allow you to save about 13 photos  if however  you re only going to email your photos  you may be able to set the camera for  quot standard quot  resolution  640 x 480 pixel size  and  quot good quot  quality  which then allows you to save up to around 59 photos  the higher the quality setting  the less  quot jaggies quot  and blurred  quot artifact quot  object you ll see in your photos  but the less photos you can store on the card  i settled for a standard physical size of 640x480  and  best  quality  which is the clearest quality setting  so i get approximately 28 photos per 4 meg card  sounds confusing  but you ll get the hang of it soon enough   the manual is very clearly written to help you understand if you re a heavy photo taker  invest as many will say here  in rechargeable batteries  i recently purchased a set of 4 nickel metal hydride  maxell  brand batteries at circuit city with the charger  for under  30  and they work well with this camera  and add to the amount of time you can use it   rating and sample photos  i ll give this camera a good rating for the casual photo taker  ebayers  real estate and insurance folks  and those who like to make small casual print  as well as those who like to email pics of the kids and pets to the grand folks  as i said before  if you re wanting a camera to take 5 star quality scenic or vacation photos   i d look for one of the olympus brands  like the 460  490  or 3030 model numbers  for that kind of quality  the dc 215 is worth the investment for it s ease of use  and adequate photo quality for the price if you d like to see some sample pics i ve taken with the dc 215

167;auto; americans travelling in europe for the first time often have a moment of culture shock when they hail a taxi and a mercedes e class or bmw 5 series pulls up to the curb  in america  these cars have been icons of intelligence and success for more than a generation  in their homeland they are more likely to be diesel powered taxis designed for durability and low operating cost than ultimate driving machines bred for the autobahn in the late 80 s ford tried to beat the germans at their own game  in 1986 they had bet the company on the groundbreaking taurus  if you weren t there  it is almost impossible to imagine the impact this car had on the american auto industry  its styling was as cutting edge as any european sedan of the time and it had much more of a european feel than any american sedan made before  it couldn t compete against the european sedans sold here  but ford wondered if the germans could remake a taxi into a world class sport sedan  could they do it with a car that had won the hearts of conservative middle america that was the challenge that faced the taurus sho throughout its eleven year production run  it was by any objective standard a worthy competitor to the midsize entries from bmw and mercedes  one with a distinctive american accent  but in the end not enough buyers could make the mental leap that this taurus was different than the one their parents had traded in their fairmont or caprice classic for b overview and driving impressions b there were three generations of the sho  the first  1989 1991  was the original  86  quot jellybean quot  taurus platform with the sho v 6 and suspension component upgrades  the final version  1996 1999  used the all new  quot oval quot  taurus platform and carried an equally new v 8  but i don t recommend either  the first generation sho was a great engine mated to a chassis that wasn t intended for it  while the third became so refined it lost much of the distinctive personality in the earlier versions  the sweet spot was the 1992 1995 second generation cars  in 1992 all taurii were redesigned and the sho received distinctive front and rear styling that gave it a crisper  stronger look than the first edition  under the skin several weaknesses and customer complaints had been addressed  and the entire platform was strengthened  giving the sho handling abilities that came closer to matching the germans than any american sedan that came before  and in 1993 it finally got the automatic transmission the pundits said it needed to win over american buyers the heart of the sho was its engine  yamaha was originally hired to design a new cylinder head for the 3 0 liter ford v 6  the head they came up with produced too much power for the ford block to live with  so ford contracted them to come up with an entire powerplant  their answer was a dual overhead cam  24 valve v 6 that only shared a three liter displacement with the engine in lesser taurus models  the engine was a marvel  with 220 horsepower available the sho was the most powerful engine in its class by a slim marging  but it weighed 400 pounds less than the merc and 500 pounds less than the bmw  this made the taurus sho the quickest car in its class more important than the numbers was how different the three cars felt in action  the mercedes  from its engine to how the ashtray door closed with a solid but velvet smooth action  felt literally like a bank vault on wheels  the bmw reeked of refinement by drivers  extremely capable yet never feeling like it would lose its composure  both were outstanding cars with clear personalities  but neither  in my book  compared to the shot of tequila and a big slap on the back feeling of the sho  when you got into the gas in the ford the engine growled  the steering wheel tugged slightly in your hands  then the growl became a roar as the tachometer needle swung quickly towards 7 000 rpm  it wasn t crude  in capable hands the sho was a remarkably composed car to drive at speed with little body roll and crisp responses  the sho was simply spicier and more engaging than the germans one of the big reasons to choose a second generation car over a first is the shifter mechanism for the five speed transaxle  first gen sho s used a cable actuated shifter that had all the feel of stirring a pot of warm molasses  starting in  92 all five speed sho s ditched the spaghetti wires for solid linkage that greatly improved the feel  but it was still notably less precise than the action on the rear wheel drive bmw with its superb five speed  all front wheel drive cars share this handicap compared to a good rear wheel drive setup  torque steer  another bane of powerful front wheel drive cars  could tug the wheel in your hands but you really had to be hamfisted with the throttle to have it effect your driving  as i mentioned earlier  in 1993 the sho got the slushbox  automatic  the critics said the market wanted  the thinking was  as only a relative few bmw s came to america with manual gearboxes and mercedes didn t offer them on any model in the e class  to compete the sho needed an automatic even if the purists had a fit over it  the critics were half right  the automatic didn t make the sho a bestseller but it did improve the feel of driving the car  this is just my personal preference  but in a midsized or larger sedan i prefer an automatic if it is done right  hustling a small light sports car up a road and snapping through shifts is one of life s greater joys  but a 3 000 pound sedan is more enjoyable when the strategy is smoothness and forethought  and a good automatic is better partnered to this style of driving  in the sho it was no contest in my book  the automatic was a better automatic than the manual was manual  huh  while the manual was improved in  92  it still had an imprecision that hindered finding a gear instinctively  the automatic was better mated to the sho  with crisp  smooth upshifts that matched the sporting personality of the car  and the effect of torque steer was greatly reduced compared to the manual  unless you are the kind of enthusiast who can t have any sports car with an automatic  the auto is a better way to go if the taurus was a bargain bmw  as reviewers and fans called it  it hid the trimmed corners well  i don t know how ford made a dime on them  i prepped new cars and did trim nvh repairs at a large ford dealer in 92 94 and quickly noticed that a loaded out taurus lx was only a couple of thousand dollars less than a sho  fully equipped  with leather  excellent power sport seats  full power accessories  power glass moonroof  premium  jbl  sound  cd and the automatic the sticker came in at less than  25 000  the e 320 and 530i weighed in at almost twice that fifty large in the same trim  it s the greatest price disparity between similar cars that i ve ever seen b reliability and maintenance b against all bets when it was in production  the second generation sho has proven itself a remarkably durable car  only three big dollar problem areas have been uncovered on the second generation cars  sho s driven in the snowbelt during winter have been known to develop corrosion in the engine subframe  it s not a fatal problem  the subframe can be replaced for a few hundred dollars  including labor  the front brakes are another consistent source of trouble  the second generation cars were slightly better but ford simply put rotors on the car that were too small to stand up to the punishment of a high performance sports sedan  the rotors get too hot and warp when used hard  and like most cars made in the last decade ford only included enough metal on the them to have them machined and trued once   maybe  if you were lucky and caught it soon enough  finally  for all the initial concern about funneling 200 lb ft of torque through a front wheel drive transaxle  the only weak link has been the clutch in the manual transmission models  the brake and clutch problems can be cured with the right application of high performance parts  and the engine subframe is a job that should be good for several years  all in all  not a bad list of  quot major quot  problem areas for a high performance car   and by contrast  the second generation base taurus models have earned a lemon reputation for blowing head gaskets in their 3 8 liter engines and eating their axod e transaxles the sho models shared no engine parts with the base models and used specially modified transmissions that have proven very durable  can anyone think of another high performance engine transmission that is more reliable than the base model one problem area that isn t unique to the sho but needs to be mentioned is the importance of keeping the thermostat and catalytic converters in good condition  if the thermostat sticks open the engine won t overheat  but something just as bad can happen  all fuel injected engines use the engine temperature as one of the major factors to determine the air fuel mixture  if the engine is running too cold  as it will when the thermostat is stuck open  the mixture will be too rich  but instead of this unburned fuel vapor pouring out the tailpipe and creating smog  it is ignited and burned in the cat  which gets much hotter than it was designed to be and begins to break apart inside  it s not a problem until you lift off the gas from a higher engine speed  like when getting off the freeway  when you do this the airflow through the engine reverses momentarily and because the cats on the sho are mounted close to the engine if there is any debris in the cat it can be sucked back into the engine  it is just a destructive as pouring metal shavings in the intake  all four areas should be checked out before buying a sho  the yamaha engine has proven to be as tough as granite  aside from possible valve guide wear in hard driven cars there haven t been any major problems with the engine at all   look for a little blue smoke at a cold startup  hard starting  or oil consumption greater than a quart every 700 miles  like most of their motorcycle engines  the sho does not have hydraulic valve adjustors so the clearance has to be set by a mechanic  but unlike a bike it s not a regular occurrence  ford specifies a major service between 60 000 and 100 000 miles that includes a valve adjustment and replacing the engine timing belt  spark plug wires and control arm bushings  it is a major bill  but nothing compared to the expense of failure if something like the timing belt lets go  and this service on the sho will cost a fraction of the same service expenses on a bmw or mercedes as the miles reach this territory   one note  the sho  like any vehicle with an all aluminium engine  should have the coolant system flushed and replaced every year other problems fall into the nitpick category  in looking through the newsgroup boards  i was pleasantly surprised to see that most of the problems owners are reporting after five years are the same ones i saw when the cars were still under warranty  most involving interior trim parts  is my relief confusing  while the lumbar support leaking and the wiper control on the turn signal stalk failing too soon is evidence that there were some areas where ford missed the mark in design and manufacture  after five to seven years i expected to see new problems emerging as the cars piled up the miles and that hasn t been the case  the good news is  the owner groups have developed inexpensive solutions for all the interior problems if you have a little mechanical ability with one exception  if you notice the driver seat rocks when you sit down or move the only fix is replacing the power mechanism  a bracket with the adjustor motors and trays that move the seat  it s not a safety hazard the seat is still firmly attached to the floor  but if you want to repair it plan on laying out about  300 for a new power mechanism   pricing and owner support b the discovery of the enthusiast and aftermarket support on the web for the sho has been another pleasant surprise  there are regional sho owner clubs across america and a strong aftermarket for replacement and high performance parts   note to gearheads  the level of aftermarket support for the v 6 sho is as good as you ll find for a camaro or mustang  at extremely affordable prices for this class  too  along with continued parts support from ford  the sho is one of the rare limited edition models that hasn t become an orphan in retirement  but it does remain one of the best values in the entire automotive market  the kelly blue book quotes a  10 200 retail price for a  95 sho automatic with 75 000 miles in my area  like when it was new that is almost exactly half the blue book for a 530i or e 320  but in my area that would buy you an immaculate car  in the last year i ve seen close to a dozen very clean 92 95 sho s with prices in the  7 000 range  and because most sho buyers weren t testosterone poisoned young adults  read camaro mustang market  the chances of finding a well maintained and cared for car are very good b conclusion b a sho has been on my list of cars to have since i worked on them at earnhardt ford  it s a terrific sports sedan at an econobox price that has held up remarkably well  and the mad scientist in me still gets an evil grin when i think about the things i wanted to do with it   and that was when i only imagine stripping all the power amenities and losing a quick 60 70 pounds just on the interior  now i can get superchargers that make up to  400 horsepower i  bottom line  as an entertaining and unique sport sedan to be appreciated for what ford created  or as the platform for a midlife crisis  the sho is impossible to beat  it was one of the most easily overlooked cars when it was new  and today it has become a hidden treasure for enthusiasts  and if a bimmer owner scoffs  as they are wont to do  just ask how he likes his taxi    brian igo  i the source for everything you ever wanted to know about the sho  and one of the best auto fan sites i ve seen on the web  is  shotimes com   this is an

stuff at reasonable prices  and the best designed website i ve seen for a speedshop i br br  ; americans travelling in europe for the first time often have  moment of culture shock when they hail  taxi and  precedes  class or bow series pulls up to the curb in america these cars have been icons of intelligence and success for more than  generation in their holland they are more likely to be diese lowered taxes designed for disability and low operating cost than ultimate driving machines bred for the autobahn in the late  ford tried to beat the germans at their own game in they had bet the company on the groundbreaking turns if you weren  there it is almost impossible to imagine the impact this car had on the american auto industry its saying was as cutting edge as any european sedan of the time and it had much more of  european feel than any american sedan made before it couldn  compete against the european sedan sold here but ford wondered if the germans could make  taxi into  world class sport sedan could they do it with  car that had won the hearts of conservative middle america that was the challenge that faced the turns she throughout its eleven year production run it was by any objective standard  worthy competitor to the midwife entries from bow and precedes one with  distinctive american accent but in the end not enough buyers could make the mental leap that this turns was different than the one their parents had traded in their fairmont or caprice classic for  overview and driving impressions  there were three generations of the she the first was the original quit jellybean quit turns platform with the she  and suspension component upgrade the final version used the all new quit oval quit turns platform and carried an equally new  but  don  recommend either the first generation she was  great engine hated to  classes that wasn  intended for it while the third became so refined it lost much of the distinctive personality in the earlier versions the sweet spot was the second generation cars in all taurida were designed and the she received distinctive front and rear saying that gave it  whisper stronger look than the first edition under the skin several weaknesses and customer complaints had been addressed and the entire platform was strengthened giving the she handling abilities that came closer to watching the germans than any american sedan that came before and in it finally got the automatic transmission the units said it needed to win over american buyers the heart of the she was its engine omaha was originally hired to design  new cylinder head for the later ford  the head they came up with produced too much power for the ford block to live with so ford contracted them to come up with an entire powerplant their answer was  dual overhead can valve  that only shared  three later displacement with the engine in lesser turns models the engine was  marvel with horsepower available the she was the most powerful engine in its class by  slim margins but it weighed pounds less than the mere and pounds less than the bow this made the turns she the quickest car in its class more important than the numbers was how different the three cars felt in action the precedes from its engine to how the astray door closed with  solid but velvet smooth action felt literally like  bank vault on wheels the bow reeked of refinement by drivers extremely capable yet never feeling like it would lose its composure both were outstanding cars with clear personalities but neither in my book compared to the shot of tutuila and  big slap on the back feeling of the she when you got into the gas in the ford the engine growled the sneering wheel tugged slightly in your hands then the growl became  roar as the tachometer needle swung quickly towards rum it wasn  crude in capable hands the she was  remarkably composed car to drive at speed with little body roll and crisp responses the she was simply species and more engaging than the germans one of the big reasons to choose  second generation car over  first is the shifted mechanism for the five speed transaxle first gen she  used  cable actuated shifted that had all the feel of stirring  pot of warm molasses starting in all five speed she  pitched the spaghetti wires for solid lineage that greatly improved the feel but it was still notably less precise than the action on the rear wheel drive bow with its superb five speed all front wheel drive cars share this handicap compared to  good rear wheel drive set true steer another bane of powerful front wheel drive cars could tug the wheel in your hands but you really had to be hamfisted with the throttle to have it effect your driving as  mentioned earlier in the she got the slushbox automatic the critics said the market wanted the thinking was as only  relative few bow  came to america with manual gearboxes and precedes didn  offer them on any model in the  class to compete the she needed an automatic even if the purity had  fit over it the critics were half right the automatic didn  make the she  bestseller but it did improve the feel of driving the car this is just my personal preference but in  midsized or larger sedan  prefer an automatic if it is done right hustling  small light sports car up  road and snapping through shifts is one of life  greater joys but  pound sedan is more enjoyable when the strategy is smoothness and forethought and  good automatic is better partner to this style of driving in the she it was no contest in my book the automatic was  better automatic than the manual was manual hut while the manual was improved in it still had an impression that hindered finding  gear instinctively the automatic was better hated to the she with crisp smooth uplifts that matched the sporting personality of the car and the effect of true steer was greatly reduced compared to the manual unless you are the kind of enthusiast who can  have any sports car with an automatic the auto is  better way to go if the turns was  bargain bow as reviews and fan called it it hid the trimmed corners well  don  know how ford made  time on them  propped new cars and did trim not repairs at  large ford dealer in and quickly noticed that  loaded out turns ll was only  couple of thousand dollars less than  she fully equipped with leather excellent power sport seats full power accessories power glass moorhof premium bl sound d and the automatic the stick came in at less than the  and  weighed in at almost twice that fifty large in the same trim it  the greatest price disparity between similar cars that  ve ever seen  reliability and maintenance  against all bets when it was in production the second generation she has prove itself  remarkably unable car only three big dollar problem areas have been uncovered on the second generation cars she  driven in the snowbelt during winter have been known to develop corrosive in the engine suffrage it  not  fatal problem the suffrage can be replaced for  few hundred dollars including labor the front rakes are another consistent source of trouble the second generation cars were slightly better but ford simply put rostovs on the car that were too small to stand up to the punishment of  high performance sports sedan the rostovs get too hot and warp when used hard and like most cars made in the last decade ford only included enough metal on the them to have them machine and tried once maybe if you were lucky and caught it soon enough finally for all the initial concern about funneling lb ft of true through  front wheel drive transaxle the only weak link has been the clutch in the manual transmission models the brake and clutch problems can be cured with the right application of high performance parts and the engine suffrage is  job that should be good for several years all in all not  bad list of quit major quit problem areas for  high performance car and by contrast the second generation base turns models have earned  lemon reputation for blowing head caskets in their later engines and eating their and  transaxles the she models shared no engine parts with the base models and used specially modified transmission that have prove very unable can anyone think of another high performance engine transmission that is more reliable than the base model one problem area that isn  unique to the she but needs to be mentioned is the importance of keeping the thermostat and paralytic converted in good condition if the thermostat sticks open the engine won  overhead but something just as bad can happen all fuel injected engines use the engine temperature as one of the major factors to determine the air fuel mixture if the engine is running too cold as it will when the thermostat is stuck open the mixture will be too rich but instead of this unburned fuel vapor pouring out the tailpipe and creating so it is united and burned in the cat which gets much other than it was designed to be and begins to break apart inside it  not  problem until you lift off the gas from  higher engine speed like when getting off the freely when you do this the inflow through the engine reverses momentarily and because the cats on the she are mounted close to the engine if there is any debris in the cat it can be sucked back into the engine it is just  destructive as pouring metal shavings in the intake all four areas should be checked out before buying  she the omaha engine has prove to be as tough as granite aside from possible valve guide wear in hard driven cars there haven  been any major problems with the engine at all look for  little blue smoke at  cold started hard starting or oil consumption greater than  quart every miles like most of their motorcycle engines the she does not have hydraulic valve adductors so the clearance has to be set by  mechanics but unlike  bike it  not  regular occurrence ford specified  major service between and miles that includes  valve adjustment and replacing the engine timing belt spark plug wires and control arm pushing it is  major bill but nothing compared to the expense of failure if something like the timing belt lets go and this service on the she will cost  fraction of the same service expenses on  bow or precedes as the miles reach this territory one note the she like any vehicle with an all aluminium engine should have the cooling system flushed and replaced every year other problems fall into the nitric category in looking through the newsgroup boards  was pleasantly surprised to see that most of the problems owners

171;camera; the minolta dimage 7 is so far the best camera i have ever used  having a minolta 35mm camera in the past  this was very easy to get used to  there are two sides to the camera  beginner and professional  one side is the camera has automatic exposure and presets for certain events  i e  sunsets and sporting events  which helps if you are new to photography  the other is filled with rich features  such as shutter speed  white balance  and color balance  the camera also has 3 types of flash modes  standard flash  red eye reduction  and rear flash sync the resolution has to be the best thing about the camera  it has an astounding resolution of 2560 x 1920 at its maximum image size  along with the resolution you can control the image quality  here are the modes of compression for the image quality  all file sizes are for the resolution 2560 x 1920  raw mode  has to be downloaded through the camera for decoding  this mode gives you the best quality at 9 5mb per picture on the card before decoding  raw is only saved as a tiff after it has been decoded  next is super fine mode  which can be saved at 14 1mb per photo  this is saved in a jpg image format  fine mode  can be saved at 2 1mb per picture  this too is saved as a jpg  standard mode can be saved at 1 1mb per picture and this too is saved in a jpg format  last  economy mode  which can be saved at 0 65mb per image and is saved in a jpg format  since when you buy the camera they give you a 16mb compact flash card  i would recommend putting the images at 2560 x 1920 and standard mode for the compression  i have a 256mb compact card which i bought additionally  can hold about 227 images at 2560 x 1920 with standard mode compression  why don t i use a better image quality since i have a big card you may ask  i do not see a difference in the photos  with fine mode and a resolution of 2560 x 1920 i only got 125 images to the 256mb card  i compared photographs taken of the same object at different image qualities and they looked the same  if you really think about it  you re only going to reduce the image anyway when you send it in an email or put it up on a website  as you reduce the image on the computer from the original 2560 x 1920  you will see it will get sharper  printing from the original image size you will see amazing results  you figure every 100 pixels equals 1 inch  so the original image if you brought it to a print shop  while maintaining the same image quality with out enlarging it would be around 25  x 19 the battery life is okay  on 4 alkaline batteries it lasts about 5 pictures  with the ni mh batteries  which the camera recommends  can last anywhere from 10 photos to 50 photos  depending on how much you use the zoom  focus and macro mode the minolta dimage 7 has to be the best camera i have ever owned  it has a beginner s side and a professional s wanting  i would highly recommend this camera who is getting started in photography and any professional that wants a inexpensive camera that is loaded with features  ;

177;auto; introduction so what the heck is this thing  thats what i wondered  i ve never heard of diatsu  dhiatsue  or yeah  daihatsu  that is  until a friend of a friend got one  this is pretty close to  if not  the first mini suv  its well worth its weight in yen so what they heck is it surprisingly enough  it was imported from japan by cadillac  the rocky was made from 1990 to 1993  it has dual overhead cams dohc  in a small four cylinder engine  we have never been able to determine the size  it is fairly small  sadly  daihatsu has either pulled out of the united states market or they went out of business  i m hoping for the first pro s well  lets see  this thing is a very nice little suv first of all  with the little engine  you can expect well over 30 mpg  probably closer to 35  once while four wheeling it  we went well below empty sweating  we were  for an estimated total of 500 miles on the gas tank which holds 15 gallons the four wheel drive worked very well  this thing would go anywhere my blazer would go  and then some this thing was after the heart of the slk kompressor lovers  with a removable hardtop in the rear  and a flip up sunroof in the front we don t know the exact mileage  since the speedometer and the odometer haven t worked since they aquired the vehicle in 1995  they have made four round trips to chicago from the grand canyon  and it is a daily driver of at least 20 miles a day  sometimes as much as 200 miles a day twice a month  my estimate is that this vehicle easily has 200 000 miles on it  with nothing mechanically wrong  the spark plugs are very easy to change  with the right wrench  and everything else mechanically speaking is easy to do even with a not so great 16 year old driver  abusing it daily  this thing is holding up great  i don t know who made the engine  if it was daihatsu or if they bought premanufactured engines  i d guess that honda built the engine since it has been so reliable neutral with the sunroof up on bumpy roads  it rattles  a lot  on smooth roads it is pretty quiet this thing easily seats four people  there isn t much more room than that  but for a compact suv  what do you expect  there is very little room behind the rear seat the spare tire somewhat hinders backing view  but nothing to worry about  and not nearly as bad as jeep wranglers or  who the heck makes this  amigo s since i think this was daihatsu first attempt at four wheel drive  manual hubs are excused  they still suck  and i ve had to get out one too many times in the mud to lock them cons with a little four banger  do you expect power  i don t  and you certainly don t get it  0 60 as tested in a race against my blazer is just under 22 seconds  being the boring town of grand canyon  we have little to do but mess with our cars  we even know the 1 4 mile time  21 5 second at 66 mph  for those of you who don t know what this means  between 17 and 19 seconds is average for most family cars  a corvette will do the quarter mile in 13 3 seconds never fear  this thing will hold freeway speeds  and highways speeds  just don t try to go up steep inclines at the speed limit don t expect to tow anything  at least in my blazer the v6 puts out quite a bit more torque than horsepower 210 torque to 173 hp  in this  thats not the case  my guess is about 100 horsepower  and 100 ft  lbs  of torque  it can barely pull around four average males  let alone any size trailer overall this little suv is ideal for college students that want a little bit of attitude to their geo  it will go anywhere  muddy or not  and we have never felt that we compromised our safety while  quot romping quot  it if you don t mind being slow  but getting great gas mileage  this is for you  the reliability is great  the comfort is too  just don t plan on hauling all of your friends and all of their stuff around br br  ; introduction so what the neck is this thing that what  wondered  ve never heard of diatsu dhiatsue or yeah daihatsu that is until  friend of  friend got one this is pretty close to if not the first mind sun its well worth its weight in men so what they neck is it surprisingly enough it was imported from japan by cadillac the rocky was made from to it has dual overhead came donc in  small four cylinder engine we have never been able to determine the size it is fairly small sadly daihatsu has either pulled out of the united states market or they went out of business   hoping for the first pro  well lets see this thing is  very nice little sun first of all with the little engine you can expect well over pg probably closer to once while four wheeling it we went well below empty sweating we were for an estimated total of miles on the gas tank which holds gallows the four wheel drive worked very well this thing would go anywhere my blazed would go and then some this thing was after the heart of the silk kompressor lovers with  removable wardrop in the rear and  lip up sunroof in the front we don  know the exact mileage since the speedometer and the odometer haven  worked since they acquired the vehicle in they have made four round trips to chicago from the grand canyon and it is  daily driver of at least miles  day sometimes as much as miles  day twice  month my estimate is that this vehicle easily has miles on it with nothing mechanically wrong the spark plugs are very easy to change with the right french and everything else mechanically speaking is easy to do even with  not so great year old driver abusing it daily this thing is holding up great  don  know who made the engine if it was daihatsu or if they bought premanufactured engines   guess that hand built the engine since it has been so reliable neutral with the sunroof up on bump roads it battles  lot on smooth roads it is pretty quiet this thing easily seats four people there isn  much more room than that but for  compact sun what do you expect there is very little room behind the rear seat the spare tire somewhat hinders backing view but nothing to worry about and not nearly as bad as deep grangers or who the neck makes this ago  since  think this was daihatsu first attempt at four wheel drive manual hubs are excused they still suck and  ve had to get out one too many times in the mud to lock them sons with  little four danger do you expect power  don  and you certainly don  get it as tested in  race against my blazed is just under seconds being the boring town of grand canyon we have little to do but mess with our cars we even know the mile time second at may for those of you who don  know what this means between and seconds is average for most family cars  coquette will do the quarter mile in seconds never fear this thing will hold freely speed and highways speed just don  try to go up steep inclines at the speed limit don  expect to tow anything at least in my blazed the  puts out quite  bit more true than horsepower true to he in this that not the case my guess is about horsepower and ft les of true it can barely pull around four average males let alone any size trailer overall this little sun is ideal for college students that want  little bit of attitude to their go it will go anywhere muddy or not and we have never felt that we compromised our safety while quit romping quit it if you don  mind being slow but getting great gas mileage this is for you the reliability is great the comfort is too just don  plan on hauling all of your friends and all of their stuff around br br

184;camera; quick update december 2003 about 3 500 photos on and it s still going strong  it s not had a rough life  but i take it  everywhere  i go  and has been dropped a few times onto carpeted floor accidentally  and survived i ve added more memory cards  they re only us 40 now  it s still a shame that smartmedia s limit is 128mb  but that s enough for 150 high quality pix  some memory cards are definitely faster than others  so it s worth looking at better brands  apparently power consumption can vary by 75  too  but i can t tell you how to determine the best card as the full technical specifications are rarely published  all i can say is that with the small difference in prices when buying online  to go for a good name brand my father has now gone digital and bought a canon a60  although in theory his camera should be better  the images are noticeably very slightly worse especially in poorer light  i was puzzled by this  naturally  as i thought technology should have moved on after some investigation i found out that not only have very few mid range digital cameras matched the lens that olympus fitted to the c3040z and its replacements  but in this model oly fitted a 1 1 8  ccd image sensor  whilst other manufacturers were fitting and have continued to fit smaller sensors  the extra 30  area increase over the 1 2 5  and f1 8 vs the typical f2 6 lens means there s more light for the sensor to work without noise in practise  from what i ve read  3m to 4m is about the optical limit of resolution for typical digicam ccds and their lenses   it s only when you get to the larger sizes used by the slr type cameras and the quality of lenses  adding more pixels to the sensors simply gives each one less light  and the smaller lenses simply don t have the resolution update 29th may 2002 i have now lived with my 3040z for a year and have a few more things to add firstly  memory  the oly uses smartmedia  which i think is a dying format  as compact flash seems to be the way of the future  so  my advice is to make sure you buy at least one spare card if you re ever going to need it the largest sm card you can buy is still only 128mb  which i think is a design limit  though cf now goes up to 1gb  however  the card does hold  150 pictures in high quality mode  these are 700k per image  roughly  the picture quality in this mode is very good  more than good enough to print a 10x8  new cards are now less than  60 for third party makes  but then you don t get the panorama feature  i m told that oly have a special firmware fix to make their cards do something special to enable panorama feature  that you would with oly media  i ve got two 128mb cards  one is oly  and the original oly 8mb which came from the camera  and only twice ever had to use the 2nd card  so it s not a big deal  i sometimes used my olympus to store downloaded files  there s a leased line at work  and i only have a modem at home  hence would like bigger memory secondly  speed  the small delay when you press the shutter button has been a bit of a niggle  it s ok when taking portraits  landscapes etc  but for motorsport it requires a lot of practise to anticipate  you can help by pre focussing  but you end up taking a lot of bad pictures  my advice is  before buying any digital camera  to try and borrow one of that type from a friend to see if you can live with it  i ve learned to live and love  despite faults  my oly thirdly  3rd party s w  i have discovered a really nifty bit of windows software which allows you to remote control your olympus camera  and do things like time lapse photography  reconfigure it etc  find it at http www pinetreecomputing com camctl asp finding this program was a real blessing  i love it  you ll be wanting a mains adaptor if you want to do any time lapse photography though apart from that  my 3040z has been trouble free despite getting quite wet at times  has only ever had one corrupted picture  low battery  so my fault  and many people have commented on the good picture quality  i still recommend it  reviews of the 4040z indicate that the extra resolution doesn t give you a benefit  because the size of the lens and the ccd is the limiting factor  however  they have improved the firmware  so unless you re not saving a packet  the 3040z will probably do everything you want and probably is much better value for money than the 4040z some sample photos from my vacation last year in california here  http paul motorbiking fotopic net show collection php id 1982 i made no special attempts to clean up these photos  they have only been cropped i have now lived with my oly 3040z for two months and taken a wide variety of pictures with it and a few motion jpeg movies  i have taken pictures in normal daylight  dusk  and night time  and generally been quite impressed i would agree with other s findings that the flash can often over expose  it s easy to tweak it down to  0 3 in the menus  so it s not really a big deal i bought the camera with a second genuine olympus 128mb memory card  as only olympus memory has a specific feature allowing panorama stitching  when i last looked  late may 2001  olympus memory cards were about 30  more expensive than standard ones i tried the camedia master software which came with the camera  on both my windows 2000 machine  a laptop  and desktop win98  and it is ok except neither machine recognise the camera is connected  so i can t do any fancy setup tricks  however  you can crop  rotate  not lossless i think  and resize pictures  and save with different quality levels  there s also a  panorama  stitch feature in the software  which i haven t used which automates the process a bit  overall i would recommend instead using  irfanview  or acdsee  search http www tucows com for them  as both support lossless jpeg rotation  irfanview needs some plugins for this the movie file format is motion jpeg  and you play it with quicktime  http quicktime apple com  the camera allows you to change the start and end of the movie  creating a new movie or overwriting the old one  which is handy if you don t have any quicktime editing software  the free quicktime player doesn t allow this  the paid for one does  pros excellent picture quality and excellent lens  and you can get adaptor to allow use of video camera tele wide adaptors  i have a 2x tele converter  and a 0 5x wideangle converter  these are about gbp100 or usd140 each for reasonable quality items good battery life   takes 4 aa batteries  so you can buy spares in any store if you ve run down your rechargeables  and much cheaper to buy extra rechargeable batteries than say camcorder ones  it also means you can use the same charger  which helps when you go on holiday  the genuine olympus charger is quite good  and is universal voltage  even though the pack doesn t say so  you don t even have to remember to switch it over automatic mode is relatively foolproof   it gets it right most of the time  and a little practise with the exposure lock means 99  of my photos were easy semi auto and manual exposure modes are useful  but i found the exposure lock to be good enough so i don t need to change modes much at all has manual focus and focus lock option  occasionally useful  though manual focus is quite fiddly and would take too long to use for anything other than still life it takes pictures quickly  and is ready for the next shot in seconds  except in raw tiff mode the video  motion jpeg  is fun and occasionally useful  and you can edit the movie in the camera very easily very easy to connect to computer  i use windows 2000  just plug into usb port  and the cable is supplied flash sync modes allow trick night time photos   first or second curtain in slow flash sync mode  there s a tiny connector for an external flash gun  which might be very useful can connect to tv or vcr to make a slideshow tape  mono sound  composite video only    the lead is supplied remembers your settings including all the customisations and is easy to reset back to factory the tripod screw hole is nice and robust  and central the battery compartment locks securely the lcd screen is easily viewable in daylight  you only need to shield it a little bit in sunlight  cons doesn t come with rechargeable batteries  but given it uses four aa cells  these are quite cheap from any decent store like frys or bestbuy   make sure you get at least 1200mah capacity cells though  i bought the real olympus ones with the oly charger  which are 1400mah capacity and last a very long time viewfinder is slightly awkward at first like other digital cameras  pressing shutter button isn t immediate the video  motion jpeg  takes just a bit too long to start up to be useful for spontaneous  filming i couldn t switch between ntsc and pal video out  so beware if you buy abroad where video system is different  most new tvs in europe will accept ntsc  but you can t record with a vcr of course unless you buy an expensive  gbp100 or more  converter raw tiff mode is very slow  which is to be expected front element of lens is hardly recessed  and it s not possible to protect with a filter  so you do need to be careful when handling  the lens cap can fall off easily  so i ve managed to put some big juicy fingerprints on the lens when the cap has fallen off and i m groping inside the camera bag when connected to tv  the slideshow always has some overlay of information which spoils the presentation a little  and it can take a while to flick between pages   there s a blank

185;auto; my interest in this marquee started out with the earlier range rover model  i was quite interested in acquiring what had been dubbed the  quot the most competent four wheel drive vehicle in the world quot however  i was left with a lot of doubt as to the credibility of this rather desirable automobile  first reason for doubt was the range rover s dubious and rather shameful reliability  this so called competent mud rucker had not endeared itself to owners all over the world with it s dubious track record on reliability  in fact  as i was hunting around for a bargain basement used   or as we say now  pre owned range rover  i found myself being deterred by   of all people   car dealers all over  i then went to a trusted friend in studio city to try to acquire this vehicle that i desired  he bluntly refused to sell me the one he had actually owned  this from a guy who treated his automobiles almost as a substitute for children  he regaled me with horror stories of trying to keep his range rover serviceable  infact he stated that he would never buy a range rover that was out of warranty  so  after feeling rather let down in my quest to acquire this automobile  i was to come to face another issue i had with the range rover  for an over  50 000 luxury automobile  it was small inside  i am 6 3 quot  tall  and can compete with most professional quarterbacks for build  i was rather disappointed by this  i don t know about you  however if i am paying that much money for a car  i would like to be able to enjoy it  and i mean really enjoy  i am not just acquiring the range rover to prove my social worth or accomplishments  or to say that i appreciate crumpets and tea or a game of polo  also  it was not to grin in pain at my neighbours as i come home from la s infamous traffic jams with my knees having lost all sensation by the time i come home  however  almost like a call to me from the marquee s manufacturer  a second edition of the range rover was released  this was the range rover town and country lwb  long wheel base  i found from test driving this car that there was more room for daddy long legs   me  at last it seemed i would be able to enjoy this luxurious marquee  however  based on the dismal reputation that the range rover seemed to have built thus far  i found my desire to acquire this vehicle was not enough to make me fork out the mulla to buy it the beginning of this review was based on the past  rover has now introduced the new range rover  and it has been with us for a few years now  fewer years than our cousins in queen s country have had the new range rover  i have again found my desire for this majestic mud rucker piqued  the new range rover now has a fair amount of pre owned examples to choose from  therefore i decided to again go out and try to quell my desire initially  i was not too taken by the look of the new range rover  it somehow seemed bland in design  almost as generic as a lot of new automobiles seemed to be during the late eighties into the nineties  however  as time went on as i started to pay a closer look at this marquee  i realized that range rover had actually created a new range rover while preserving the traditional look and dare i say lines of the older model  it was more of an evolutionary design if not wildly revolutionary  as time wore on  i also realized it was actually distinguishable from other suv s on the road  if you did not recognize her majesty s official mudrucker by it s new design  then i found you could hardly miss it s share size  it had presence and visual dominance on the road when it appeared  and at the same time  it exuded it s elegance and class  i often joked that it was what a suburban would look like in a tuxedo  it was james bond on steroids after deciding that the new range rover had a face that not only a mother could love  but one that i had come to appreciate  i decided that it was time for me to go put it through it s paces  now what i wanted was to be able to spend a bundle of hard earned dollars on an suv that would make me feel like royalty forgive the pun  but this vehicle had to be reliable enough to where it would need a third mortgage to maintain   the second mortgage bought it  it also had to be comfortable enough as a long distance hauler and a traffic jam haven  now  i did mention the part of feeling like royalty  well  no doubt a lot of people will say this is a trait of and angeleno  but i wanted my suv to have enough snob appeal to say class without being  to crass  i first began my quest by researching the new range rover s reliability  much to by delight  it was rave reviews all the way  things like  quot  i have been delighted with the performance of my rover to date quot  and this would be two to three years later  or from my dear friend in studio city   quot i am glad that i decided to try another rover  for once i did not have to wear out my warranty quot  so with this positive feedback already on the side of the new range rover  i went in search of the ideal candidate to literally fill my garage  i also went to a couple of large range rover dealers to see if i can obtain an even more knowledgeable review of the car s reliability  even though i was expecting to get somewhat biased reviews  i was still pleased to hear that the car was indeed proving it s reliability  when i went out in search of my ideal candidate  i was quite in amazed at the number of range rovers available to the used car buyer  and also the asking price for them  to say that depreciation was rather harsh to this automobile would be an understatement to me  i found quite a handful of range rovers ranging in age between 18 months to two years old  the average mileage was between 38 000 to 50 000 miles  to me  the examples i found were quite clean and well kept  after all  the truth of the matter is that not all of us can afford these marquees new  the prices i found ranged from  32 000 for newer ones with lower miles to  29 000 for slightly older ones with mileage in the high forties to fifties  i thought this was not a bad deal  considering this meant up to  20 000 less than a new one  and they still looked in impeccable condition  even the examples i found at the larger range rover dealerships were only a little bit more expensive than the ones i found here and there a bit of the ole writer s block here  sincere apologies  i will finish this soon  thank you for your patience     ; my interest in this marque started out with the earlier range rover model  was quite interested in acquiring what had been dubbed the quit the most competent four wheel drive vehicle in the world quit however  was left with  lot of doubt as to the credibility of this rather

the range rover was released this was the range rover town and country lb long wheel base  found from test driving this car that there was more room for daddy long legs me at last it seemed  would be able to enjoy this luxurious marque however based on the dismal reputation that the range rover seemed to have built thus far  found my desire to acquire this vehicle was not enough to make me fork out the full to buy it the beginning of this review was based on the past rover has now introduced the new range rover and it has been with us for  few years now fewer years than our cousins in queen  country have had the new range rover  have again found my desire for this majestic mud pucker piquet the new range rover now has  fair amount of pre owned examples to choose from therefore  decided to again go out and try to quell my desire initially  was not too taken by the look of the new range rover it somehow seemed bland in design almost as genetic as  lot of new automobile seemed to be during the late eighties into the nineties however as time went on as  started to pay  closer look at this marque  realized that range rover had actually created  new range rover while preserving the traditional look and dare  say lines of the older model it was more of an evolutionary design if not wildly revolutionary as time wore on  also realized it was actually indistinguishable from other sun  on the road if you did not recognize her majesty  official mudrucker by it  new design then  found you could hardly miss it  share size it had presence and visual dominance on the road when it appeared and at the same time it exuded it  elegance and class  often joked that it was what  suburban would look like in  taxed it was james bond on steroids after deciding that the new range rover had  face that not only  mother could love but one that  had come to appreciate  decided that it was time for me to go put it through it  paces now what  wanted was to be able to spend  bundle of hard earned dollars on an sun that would make me feel like royalty forgive the put but this vehicle had to be reliable enough to where it would need  third mortgage to maintain the second mortgage bought it it also had to be comfortable enough as  long distance haulers and  traffic jam haven now  did mention the part of feeling like royalty well no doubt  lot of people will say this is  trait of and angeles but  wanted my sun to have enough snow appeal to say class without being to crass  first began my quest by searching the new range rover  reliability much to by delight it was have reviews all the way things like quit  have been delighted with the performance of my rover to date quit and this would be two to three years later or from my dear friend in studio city quit  am glad that  decided to try another rover for once  did not have to wear out my warranty quit so with this positive feedback already on the side of the new range rover  went in search of the ideal candidate to literally fill my garage  also went to  couple of large range rover dealers to see if  can obtain an even more knowledgeable review of the car  reliability even though  was expecting to get somewhat based reviews  was still pleased to hear that the car was indeed proving it  reliability when  went out in search of my ideal candidate  was quite in amazed at the number of range rovers available to the used car buyer and also the asking price for them to say that depreciation was rather harsh to this automobile would be an understatement to me  found quite  handful of range rovers ranging in age between months to two years old the average mileage was between to miles to me the examples  found were quite clean and well kept after all the truth of the matter is that not all of us can afford these marquis new the prices  found ranged from for newer ones with lower miles to for slightly older ones with mileage in the high forties to cities  thought this was not  bad deal considering this meant up to less than  new one and they still looked in implacable condition even the examples  found at the larger range rover dealerships were only  little bit more expensive than the ones  found here and there  bit of the ole writer  block here sincere apologies  will finish this soon thank you for your patience

202;camera; i love this camera  i used  and have kept  my trusty olympus d450z for almost 2 years  and became hooked on a digital camera  the d450z was great except   the 1 3megapixel ccd did limit me to at most 5x7 prints  it used a slow serial port transfer  the 3x optical zoom was just not sufficient for too many pictures i wanted to take the c700uz with its 2 1megapixels  usb  and 10x zoom has solved all these issues  i am not by any means a professional photographer  and to get professional reviews  i suggest going to  http www imaging resource com  http www steves digicams com  http www dpreview com http www cnet com i will provide here a general user s review  my main interests in picture taking have been of family pictures  indoor and outdoor  my kids  sports  soccer and basketball  and vacation and scenery  family pictures work well  and the flash unit is quite acceptable  sports pictures have worked very well for outdoor events  i have discovered that you need to take many sports action pictures to get one decent one  using a digital camera i can as many pictures as i want and only keep the good ones  of course  the camera has an action setting  and the 10x zoom has been invaluable for getting some incredible soccer pictures  i do recommend  however  that you use a tripod to help steady the camera   the olympus 2100uz does come with an image stabilization feature  but the camera is significantly larger  for my uses  i wanted the smaller size  trying to take indoor basketball pictures has not been very successful  but it may have to do with the poor lighting in the gyms  scenery pictures have also been excellent  but i have occasionally encountered what is called chromatic aberration  in high contrast areas of a picture  for example  a bright sky behind the dark leaves of a tree  the pictures appear with a purplish tinge around them  it isn t particularly glaring or problematic  but it happens frequently enough on that really great picture that you will want to try to tone it down  it can easily be done with the high end photo editing software  eg  photoshop  but the cheapest  free  and easiest way to do it is with serif s photoplus 5 0  this free download  http www serif com downloads asp  allows you to select a tonal range across an entire picture and then reduce its contrast   i have not found any other mid  to low end product that can do this  photodeluxe  pictureit  photodraw  image composer  photoimpact  smartphoto  other scattered observations  the camera comes with an 8mb smartmedia card  you will find heated discussions about the superiority of one of the media formats smartmedia  compactflash  memory stick  etc but i have been very pleased with smartmedia  it is small  and it is now also cheap   i have purchased a 64mb card for  35  some people prefer to have a high mb card  but i have gone with cards in the 16  32  or 64 range both because they are cheaper and because i won t lose everything if i should happen to lose one card  i have also purchased a microtek cameramate usb smartmedia cf reader  i use it to download images from the card without always having to use the camera  which does come with a usb transfer cable  i can also use this device and the sm cards as portable storage devices for any file type  the camera comes with a new lithium ion battery pack  but you will quickly want to get nimh rechargeable batteries  battery life in general is quite good  i can take about 150 shots or so  viewing  deleting  etc on one set of charged batteries  i like the clamshell design on my old d450z  the c700uz is larger  but it is still unbelievably compact for a 10x optical zoom  many of the older olympus models had a lens capped that dropped off when the camera was turned on  but the c700uz lens cap now has a retainer cord  once you have a 10x optical zoom  it is hard to go to anything else   i never even bother with the digital zoom  you can enlarge pictures later on the computer  the camera comes with an ntsc a v cable so you can plug the camera into a tv or vcr and view your pictures onscreen  it s a great way to share pictures  note that many other cameras do not have this feature  the included camedia software is fine  but i find that i mostly use the built in preview feature of windows explorer on my winme system  you will want another photoediting program to do any significant editing  the 1 5  tft lcd works quite well  even in bright outdoor light  you can even shoot up to 15 second movies with this camera  they aren t the greatest quality  but it is a nice extra feature  the viewfinder is not a through the lens type but is  as i understand it  actually a mini lcd panel  the advantage to it is that your picture comes out just as you see it  the disadvantage is that there is some loss of detail  and it can be a bit dim  it works well enough  the camera can be used pretty much as a point and shoot if you want using the auto setting  you do have other automatic settings  landscapes  portraits  action  and if you want  you can take full control of all settings  i find that the automatic settings are useful for most purposes  but i do some manual settings when i want to do macro mode  play around with flash effects  when i want to set white balance settings under different lighting situations  eg  flourescent  or adjust iso settings  the camera has an amazing iso 800 equivalency which is great for low light shots  it is possible to buy a cla 4 adaptor and add lens  filters  etc to this camera  i have settled on using the highquality jpeg setting  each picture uses about 450k or so  the quality is excellent for producing up to 8x10  prints  i keep all my pictures on my computer and burn to cd  i print some of the pictures on my inkjet  for pictures i want as prints  i upload to sites like ofoto or clubphoto  i recently have begun using walmart s services and have been satisfied  to really get all the potential out of this camera  which i am not doing  you need to read the manual  there is a brief starter manual printed  but you really have to read the full manual which only comes on the included cd  the camera feels well balanced and well made and has been quite durable and sturdy  i waited until bestbuy had one of their 10  off anything 3 day sales to get my camera at a price comparable to the best online price available  ;  love this camera  used and have kept my trusty polypus   for almost years and became hooked on  digital camera the   was great except the megapixel cod did limit me to at

got my first and only saab  during my junior year of college i commuted in a 1982 oldsmobile omega  this was not a good car  the 1982 omega featured the infamous chevy built 2 8 liter v 6  probably  the worst engine ever   as it s often sited  i bought this car from one of my father s coworkers  but this car was very well taken care of  not a speck of rust was to be found  the interior looked as if no human had graced its presence  all maintenance records were in order and detailed  this car was supposed to last me until i landed my first job  and then some  but it didn t  granted  the car ran flawlessly for the first six months i owned it  but then it began to turn against me  the radiator went ka boom in the middle of boston  the air conditioner was so powerful it turned the car off  if i was going up a hill  in winter  i had to turn off the radio  heater  and rear window defroster to have enough power to climb the hill  it was an under whelming car the car soon began to die a quick death and that s when i was on the lookout for another car  again  another of my father s coworkers decided to assist me in my quest for reliable transportation  ha  anyway  this friend had another friend who had a saab for sale  and for the sake of story  let s just say that this friend of a friend was shifty the saab was kept at this friend of a friend s work  a sunoco station where he was a mechanic  he showed me to the car  it was covered in  clever  bumper stickers and there appeared to be a young tree growing through the engine bay  but i was hopeful  sanguine  i took the key from his meaty hands and turned the ignition  the car grumbled to life right away  i shifted into first gear and drove around the gas station  a very thorough test drive we told him we would take it  the cost was  900 the mechanic who owned the saab said he just had to find the title at his house and that he would pass it along to my father s friend who in turn would pass it along to my father who would hopefully pass it along to me one month later i received the title  it was a little suspicious  the name signed on the back was not the mechanic s name  but a woman s name  and then there was the date  the date was off by 10 months  dated 10 months earlier  what happened  was there some sort of shift in the space time continuum that i was not aware of i brought the title over to my insurance agent and she looked the title over and said   well  the registry probably won t even notice  in fact  if they do  they will just assume she s old okay b the bad saab mechanic in newburyport  ma  he was a bad man  a real bad man  here s my little story  my car wouldn t start  or more accurately  it started but intermittently  as my spider sense tingled i determined that this was a problem  so  i drove down to my trusty local mechanic and relayed to him the problem at hand a few hours later i received a phone call from the very same mechanic  my mechanic  he stated that he didn t really know what was wrong with the car  he confessed to me  although i am not a priest and he is not catholic but muslim  that he didn t work much on saabs but that he had the name of a very good saab mechanic as soon as he revealed to me the name of this saab master mechanic i called and told this swedish automotive sage my story  after concluding the phone call i was on my way to newburyport  almost 13 miles from my house two days later the saab master mechanic called my home to tell me the car was ready  after much excitement and washing of hands  i asked my father for a ride to the garage to collect my car  little did i know what was in store we arrived at the garage a short time later and the saab master mechanic greeted us warmly  he grabbed the keys to my car and showed me what i had hoped for  the car started  right away  the first try  victory was mine then the bill came what the problem was with the bill was not the price  it was actually low  especially for a saab  but there was an extra item added into the grand total that called my attention  a towing charge b a very short play  me what s this towing charge  i drove the car here saab master mechanic well  i often drive home the cars i m working on  and your car died in my driveway  and i had to have it towed me you re charging me for your tow saab master mechanic yup me but i told you the car was having trouble starting  why would you drive it home saab master mechanic it s how i work me but that doesn t seem fair saab master mechanic alright  you don t have to pay the towing charge  and if you don t  you can never bring the car back here again at this point my father interrupted and said   okay  fine  here  and paid for my towing charge  i never went back to the saab master mechanic  on the way home i stopped by my regular mechanic and i told him   look  i don t care if you have to work from a book  i m not going back to that saab guy  i then told my mechanic what had happened at the saab guy  my mechanic apologized for the unpleasantness i experienced and said he would do his best with my saab  what a guy  and boy  did he make some major mistakes b radiator  starter  alternator  battery  fuel pump  and breaks  unknown to me at the time  my newly purchased saab had been dormant for quite some time  dormancy is just about the worst one can do to a car  parts  major and expensive parts  corrode and deteriorate  i drove my saab for approximately one month before it turned against me  several times first  the radiator went  no problem  i got a used one off dad s co worker and dad installed it  thanks daddy  the starter was next  which was misdiagnosed by my mechanic  and i ended up with a new alternator  then the starter was replaced  but this was undermined by the fact that the battery was now dead  off to the sears auto center i go  die hards  please  now the car could produce and use electricity  another attack on my bank account quickly followed as a faulty fuel pump  the one in the gas tank saabs have two fuel pumps  choked my car into submission and left me stranded at work on a cold new england winter night  daddy b final tips and good things about saabs  50 50 reliability  saabs either last forever or fall apart  that s just the way it is  of course  people of higher incomes will have a much better time with their saabs since they can afford the high maintenance bills if you re buying used  make sure that the car was well maintained  of course  this goes for any car  but with saabs it s especially true saabs don t rust easily you too can often put high mileage on a saab  i ve seen saabs with well over 300 000 miles on their odometers  and they weren t even being being towed join a saab club and learn to do some repairs on your own  you can get factory parts for cheap  real cheap  this will save you money  lots of money comfy seats  it s like driving around in your living room  if your living room is very small and encased in sheet metal the engine doesn t leak  despite the fact that my car had all these aforementioned mechanical problems  the engine itself was always reliable and never leaked spacious engine bay for you to work in  if you like doing that sort of thing  i tried to install spark plugs once and didn t tag the spark plug wires and reinstalled them into the wrong positions  that was a rough start

of mine  we went to school together  and after the spring semester was over  she went home to maine  i drove my saab up to maine every other weekend to see her halfway through the summer  i received a  letter  from her and it was not  good news  she announced that she had gotten a new haircut and was now a new woman  and i was history  yup the saab soon bankrupted me  new breaks   700  and i had to sell it  my parents had been assisting me financially for the upkeep of this car  but i felt bad that it was costing so much money  i sold the saab to another of my father s coworkers for  500  he

208;auto; it was always my dream to own a hummer  i wanted it so bad ever since i was a kid  and recently i finally got one  it s difficult to own and maintenance  but is well worth it features pros huge tires  these tires are bigger than my 7 year old son  they are huge and well worth it  even though a set ends up costing over  500  its well worth it  when i took this beast up to the mountains  i was amazed at the stuff it could do  it was driving over 5 foot rocks like there was nothing there  this thing was driving through 4 feet of water with ease like it would on the road  it is definately a vehicle for the offroad  no wonder they use them in the army  tough  you can t imagine how tough these things are  i smacked into a tree head on at 70 mph and there was barely a scratch on it  i mean just imagine if that was a car  sure the other people wouldn t be lucky to hit you  but you are almost garunteed survival  with the hge tires  you d probably end up running them over like that 5 foot rock  it s just about the safest little beast you can ride  it s very intimidating to see this monterous beast driving up to you with its huge form  it has a the same width of an 18 wheeler and almost as tall  nobody ll get in your way with this thing fame  whenever i go anywhere with my hummer  even just a small trip to the grocery store  there is almost always somebody there to ask about my hummer  it ll make you feel like you re a star  when somebody comes up and asks questions and says that they wish they had a hummer  if you don t like being popular  don tget a hummer  but who wouldn t love the envy of others  surprisingly quiet  i once rode in a 1992 hummer at my uncles house as a child  and i remembered the huge car  huge tires  and huge sound  it was like driving one of those old submarines where you go deaf after two hours  the radio had to be up all the way just to hear it  but now  somehow they kept that same ominous look and feel  without that apocalyptic sound  you can take a nice quiet drive down the road at night without waking up the whole neigborhood  2 000 pund winch  there is an option to get a 2 000 pound winch and i would suggest getting it  now you can put your hummer to work  drag entire trees into your campsite and other things on that subject  i once tried to use my hummer for water skiiing in a small lake  i don t suggest this  but still  it s great to have it  you can do alkmost anything with the hummer if you get this cons gas guzzler  as much as i wanted a hummer as a child  i did research and found out what it was really like  it gets horriblegas mileage and uses hard to find deisel  they give you a huge tank for a reason  you can hold about 45 gallons in the primary and auxillary tanks  so it is well eqipped to last about 500 1000 miles  it s much better on the highway because you can control the road with the fear of others and you don t have to slow down often  and in the woods its a powerhouse  but i would neer use my hummer to commute  i made a pact with myself never to own a regualar car  so i drive a saturn vue most places  it gets good gas mileage  but that s off the subject  don t get the hummer as your primary vehicle  because you ll be spending hundreds on gas  every week or so  i do take my hummer to work just to show it off  but it s just not healthy to take it every day sluggish steering  i found it to have some slow steering to no surprise  i have gotten used to it but in the beginning  i couldn t take it anywhere  it really is a bit difficult to go most places until you get used to the way it works and it is not fun when you re waiting  but it is well worth it because once you get used to it  it s a huge  mean  fighting machine space  it takes up a lot of space  i can t fit it in my garage  but it doesn t get dirty in the rain  and you can t park it at those parking garges with height limits most of the time  and sometimes you have to hang out of the wondow to pick up your food at the drive through  but the size pays off  if you re going to meet someone  they can t miss a huge green hummer  and it strikes fear on the hearts of millions  but the size does limit it places to go  another reason i prefer my vue  ;

209;camera; i had been wanting a digital camera  researching all the sites  reading reviews  and had decided on the casio exilim series  the old advantix died in may  so  my camera purchase was forced  i ordered the exilim z3 from cdw in may 2003  but  after waiting 4 weeks with no known due date  i cancelled the order  i started looking elsewhere and couldn t find this camera anywhere  i contacted casio for help  they told me to try radio shack  i couldn t image they would have such a high tech toy as i hadn t been in a radio shack for years  was i shocked  i took my boss with me  of who was also going to buy one  our local radio shack had one  so  he called around  there was no radio shack within a 3 hour radius that had one  they were all sold out  radio shack had a promotion with which i received a free carrying case  static lcd screen protectors and a cleaning kit  this seems to be a hot item to say the least this camera is great  it has a best shot feature that sets the exposure  white balance  focus  etc  for you based on what you are taking photos of  this best shot feature shows you a sample picture of these settings and describes what the setting does  there are 21 preset settings and you have the option to make your own  i use sunset  portrait  and portrait with scenery most often  it is really easy to use  it will also allow you to set these items yourself  which i m sure the pros would love  another interesting setting is the white balance  on auto  the camera compensates well  however  i have found the under fluorescent lighting  you need to set white balance to fluorescent  there are six settings  auto  full sun  shade  incandescent  fluorescent  and manual the camera also allows you to take 30 second live video with sound  the sound is pretty good as long as there is no wind to ruffle the sound  the video is better than video i have seen on a lot of cameras the camera has 3x optical zoom and 9x digital zoom  giving you a total of 12x zoom  i have windows xp on my computer  so  when i hooked the base up to my usb port  xp immediately recognized it  installed the drivers and asked me what i wanted to do  you can browse the file system on the camera as it is docked just like it was another hard drive  i didn t need to install any software and transferring the pictures is as simple as copying and pasting i contacted support once more to be sure there were no issues with the 128mb sd memory card  i contacted them via e mail and i had an answer in two hours  you get a  real  person at customer service  you get their  personal  e mail address  and they are really friendly with the 128mb sd memory card i can take the following 31   30 second videos 68   2048x1536 fine pictures 105   1600x1200 fine pictures 163   1280x960 fine pictures 584   640x480 fine pictures 767   640x480 normal pictures 1227   640x480 economy pictures each quality setting allows for any resolution  i just didn t list all of them here i have yet to run the battery dead  after a week at the beach and around 300 pictures videos  so  i m not sure of the available battery time the time between shots is around 2 seconds and the time between actually pushing the record button and getting the picture can sometimes lag around a second  it really seems to depend on the situation  which i assume is related to auto focus  however  this is still much better than our advantix was so  no complaints here on that subject there are several features that we still haven t played with and after downloading the pdf for full documentation  we still haven t read through all 100  pages two features we find to be the coolest are  on screen cropping of photos  and the 3x timer feature  the on screen cropping feature will allow you to center shots  the 3x timer feature will take the first photo after 10 seconds  the second photo after 1 second  and then the last photo after another 1 second  this proved very good for the latest family picture of 38 people  the last picture being the best the red eye reduction feature is also interesting in that upon snapping the picture the camera flashes several times  so  if the cool camera wasn t drawing enough attention the flash sure will  the most common comments   147what was that 148   147can i see it 148   147how does that zoom work 148  ;

210;camera; don t get me wrong  the canon elph s200 is an awesome camera  it s super compact  it takes great photos  clear up to an 8x10  it s simple to use  it takes decent mpegs  and it looks way cool this is the perfect camera for anyone taking simple snapshots of friends and family  i bought this before my first child was born so that i had a digital camera during labor and delivery and could send out those first pictures of the baby over the internet with a quickness  it worked out great  the pictures were very clear  even in low light  i m not sure why there are complaints on the flash quality  we had absolutely no problems in that area  even when i couldn t see the baby on the lcd screen because the room was too dark  the flash was definitely bright enough to take a great picture i also love that it uses the compact flash card rather than a smart card  since more and more things are using a flash card rather than the smart media  i am able to swap my ipaq s card with my elph s and always have a spare the battery life has also not been an issue for us  as you can imagine  being new parents we take tons of pictures  i typically take about ten pictures a day and maybe three movies a week  i do not charge my battery more than once a week  if that  so  in other words  the battery lasts for quite some time  i also love the fact that the battery is rechargeable  and it does quickly recharge  about an hour and a half after the first charge  because we would be going through a million batteries otherwise the camera is also sturdy and durable  i take this camera with me every where and it usually travels by diaper bag so it gets thrashed around quite a bit  it also has gotten occasionally  misted  or gotten some baby finger goop on it  but it cleans up like a champ and i have not had one problem with it working improperly or being damaged i have a few complaints about the camera   i wish the zoom was better  i know that the digital zoom can get right up close  but you lose so much resolution when you print that i never go past the 2 0 optical zoom  usually  that s close enough  but now that my little one is walking  it is hard to get a nice  close up shot when he s across the room  there is lens adapter so no additional lenses can be attached  there is no battery life indicator  this makes it difficult to determine when the battery needs charging  until it gets too late  i wish it came with a carrying case  canon offers a camera case specifically for the elph  but from what i can remember  they were a bit pricey  we opted for getting a generic holder  which works great  but it would have been nice if it came with the package when we bought the camera the shutterlag can get a bit annoying  if you always push the shutter halfway down so that the camera has ample time to focus and what not  then the shutter  obviously  won t lag  but if you want to take a quick photo to capture that perfect moment  you may just miss it because the camera took too long to do its business  this is not terribly pronounced  but it does happen  the 16mb compact flash card is a joke  considering how inexpensive flash cards have become  you would think canon would spring for a 128 or something  i really do like this camera  it certainly serves its purpose at the moment  eventually it will be traded in for a camera that accepts additional lenses and  of course  has more megapixels  ;

216;camera; if you read my s200 review  you know how i got the s330 camera  my brother got a good deal on this camera at dell com with 10  off and a stackable  25 off  250 coupon  the final price came out to  324 with free shipping and no sales tax  the camera s mrsp is  499 but you will find it on store shelves and web sites for  399 and under b the short take  the s330 is the 2002 update to the powershot s300 camera that was fairly popular  although i believe it was not as popular as the s110 last year  the s300 was a solid performer that offered more user features than the more basic s110  the s330 improves the camera here and there and adds a few new twists to the design and function  for the most part  the s330 seems to be a tweaked version of the s300 model the similarities of the s330 to s300 start with both being 2 megapixel camera with 3x optical zoom and 2 5x digital zoom  the basic camera size is about the same but still slightly larger than the s110 s200 digital elph  the s330 retains all the features of the s300 with alot of tweaking done by canon  just a few new features make its appearance on the s330 just like on the s200  also debuting is the enhanced lithium ion battery for the s330 s200 models  the nb 1lh battery the main perceived weaknesses of this camera are the short battery life despite the improved battery  2 megapixel capacity  and a perceivable size difference from the s110 s200 model  despite having just slightly larger numbers in dimensions and weight  the s330 feels like a much different and heavier beast than the light and tiny s110 despite what the numbers say again  the main competition here seems to be canon powershot s200 and minolta dimagex  however  because of the larger camera size  other competitors include the nikon coolpix 2500  775  885  canon s30  s40  several olympus and fuji models as well  the s300 is smaller than most of the camera listed above with the exceptions of the s200  the dimagex  and perhaps the coolpix 2500 overall  the s330 is a worthy successor to the s300 but doesn t warrant an upgrade from the s300  it is a solid take anywhere camera that provides a bit more manual controls if you so desire it b i pros i b 1  fairly compact size 2  2 megapixel camera 3  3x optical zoom 4  compactflash media 5  movie record  limited 6  multiple on camera photo effects 7  direct printing to specific canon printers like 820d  dpof   digital print order format 8  aiaf system  artificial intelligence autofocus 9  adjustable iso settings 10  self timer 11  stainless steel case 12  accepts batteries from s110 s300 model elph b i cons b i 1  size difference looks and feels substantial to s110 s200 camera 2  only 2 megapixel camera 3  short battery life despite enhanced lithium ion batteries 4  expensive batteries 5  weak flash 6  edge mount for tripods b detail time  if you ve seen the s200  then there isn t alot of difference between the two in overall styling  the s330 has a couple more buttons and an external speaker as well  the s330 is similarly styled like the s300 the s330 s dimensions are 3 7 x 2 5 x 1 3 inches with a weight of 9 7 oz  with compactflash card and battery installed  compared to the s200 s dimensions 3 4 x 2 2 x 1 1 inches and weight of 6 6 oz  before cf card and battery  7 7 oz  with cf card and battery  it seems like a scant 0 2 inches in each dimension and a slight weight difference of 2 oz  well  that s a 25  difference in weight and the slight difference in dimensions adds up to a camera that looks and feels much bigger and heavier than the s200 camera  the unit is 0 1 inches thicker but a tad lighter than the s300 unit  those of you who are interested in portability should line the s200 and s330 next to each other at the store  the difference is extremely noticable like the s200  the body is made out of a high impact polycarbonate casing with a stainless steel plating  this change in body design may one of the reasons the s330 is significantly cheaper than the s300 model  a 1 5 inch color lcd with anti reflective coating graces the back of the camera with the same 8 large button layout as the s200  all buttons are easy to press and the user interface is also much easier to use  the s330 retains the retracting lens that slows up turning on and off the camera  the lens is automatically covered when the lens is fully retracted the 1 5 inch 1 18 megapixel color lcd that has existed since the first digital elph was released still displays your photos in fine detail and color  it is fairly easily seen in bright sunlight  and it displays even more information that the previous digital elph models before it  information such as iso settings  file size compression settings  flash settings  your shooting mode  metering  resolution type  macros  and even a histogram for tonal distribution  which i really don t know what to do with yet  but i ll learn it soon enough  photos taken using the lcd screen are just about the photos you are recording to file  95  accuracy  since the optical viewfinder is less accurate  85  by some reviews  i find that the lcd shows most of the picture you are taking versus the optical viewfinder b it s all about the pictures  the s330 does a commendable job taking shots for 4x6  5x7  and even gives acceptable 8x10 photos  my canon powershot s40 gave equivalent photos at the 4x6 and 5x7 size  enlarging the shots beyond the 5x7 size is where most 3 and 4 megapixel camera show their superiority  under the best of conditions  8x10 photos are rather decent with some loss of detail and slight pixelation which is more than you can say for some 2 megapixel cameras and even some 3 megapixel cameras   my experience has been with mostly canons  nikons  and a few olympus cameras  the 3x optical zoom is great since the digital zoom is fairly unreliable  as it is for most digital cameras  in maintaining picture details color reproduction has only gotten better in the s330 over the s110 and s300 elphs  the s330 shots look a little more natural to me than the s110 s300 models  details in photos are sharp and the automatic exposure controls do a great job in a wide range of lighting conditions  the aiaf system does a good job in low light conditions although the flash is a bit weak beyond 8 10 feet from the camera  nighttime conditions  the aiaf system works by using three points of reference on the camera to set the focus of the camera  allowing you to take shots with clear and good contrast with little effort on your part   note that the aiaf system existed in the s300 model as well the s330 performs extremely well as a simple  point and shoot  camera b the outer look of the s330  in some ways  the camera looks like a larger version of the s200  the s330 keeps to the overall stylings of the digital elph cameras  the camera has a stainless steel exterior that feels extremely smooth for the most part and smudges with fingerprints rather easily  especially the chromed finished areas of the camera  the front face has a slightly raised  ridged area housing the lens  optical viewfinder  and aiaf lamp  the diminutive flash sits at the upper right corner  when looking straight at the camera  the top panel of the camera houses the microphone  shutter  on off button  and dial for shooting mode  the dial could be set from automatic shoot mode  manual shoot mode  stitch assist  movie  and browse mode  the on off button required that you press it down for 1 2 secs to turn on the camera but a single press to shut it off  the right panel of the camera  looking at the back of the camera  houses the cover for the type i cf slot and the wrist strap attachment  the left panel houses the a v connection and usb connector covered by an attached rubber cover  the bottom panel has the battery cover and the tripod mount which lies at the far left side of the camera  unfortunately the back of the camera houses the 1 5 inch lcd  4 large buttons beneath the lcd which are the set  menu  display  and exposure compensation white balance photo effects buttons  a slightly raised circular section to the right of the lcd that acts as a 4 way direction pad for the menus and as secondary buttons for features like spot metering  macro infinity  flash  and continuous self timer mode  there is a thumb rest indentation under the mode dial and right of that is the cf cover latch  the upper left corner of the back of the s330 is the opening for the external speaker and the optical viewfinder to the left of that  the upper right corner has two buttons for zooming in and out  most of the buttons  except the two leftmost buttons under the lcd  are within reach of your thumb  by the way  i use medium sized gloves b battery life  the overall battery life is a bit better than the s300 although not by much  with the display turned on and all the automatic features enabled  you might get 150 180 shots per fully charged battery  however  if you have the lcd display turned off  you can take nearly 450 shots  using the older nb 1l battery cuts the numbers down by nearly 30  so you get 100 120 shots with the lcd on and 300 320 shots with the lcd off  too bad the newer nb 1lh battery runs at least  50 and usually in the  70 80 range  if you can find it b some features and file size issues  some new features to the s330 include an orientation sensor so that the camera will automatically rotate the photo into the proper viewing position  support for the cp 10  cp 100  and 820d canon photo printers  the  my camera  options   long shutter  mode  for low  dim  and nighttime lighting shots  enhanced white balancing selections  option between 2 and 10 second self timer  sound playback on the camera itself  exposure flash exposure autofocus lock modes  spot metering  manual iso settings from 50 400  and enhanced selection of photo effects directly on camera the  my camera  mode changes simple things like sounds the camrea makes when being turned on as well as backgrounds for menus  two default settings are included with room for one more  you can upload sounds and backgrounds through the zoombrowser software included in the package the continuous shoot mode is actually much faster with the lcd off  with the lcd on you get a slow shot per second rate  but this rate at least doubles with the lcd completely off  the rate with lcd off approaches 3 shots per sec on certain resolutions compared to 1 5 1 8 shots per second with the lcd on  the continuous shoot mode allows the user to take several consecutive photos when holding down the shutter button  you can turn off the aiaf system which gives you a single center autofocus point  this does speed up the amount of time it takes to capture photos  the digital zoom can also be turned off as well  the af assist beam can also be turned off  although i wouldn t recommend it in low night and nighttime shooting  you can also set the long shutter setting in manual shoot mode from 1 to 15 seconds long resolutions range from large  1600x1200  medium  1024x768  and small  640x480  compression ranges from super fine  largest file setting  fine  and normal  smallest file setting  an average large super fine photo takes around 1 mb of memory  this gets a bit larger with more complex pictures movie mode is quite limited for the s330  you can get 640x480 resolution at 20 frames per second  fps  for a total of 4 secs  320x240 resolution at 20 fps for a total of 10 seconds  and 160x120 resoltuion at 20 fps for a total of 30 seconds  the total file size of the movie cannot exceed 4 mb and is stored only in avi format  i haven t found the movie mode very useful so far b what s in the package  canon has always included excellent manuals and documentation for the camera and software included in all their camera packages  the s330 is no different  a good sized camera and software manual is included detailing basic and advanced functions for the camera  a wrist strap is included in the package as well as an updated lithium ion battery compared to the s110 s300  the battery has the same size and shape as the nb 1l found in the s110 and s300 cameras but is now dubbed the nb 1lh and carries 840 mah versus the nb 1l s 680 mah charge  the same battery charger is also included in the package  you can use the older nb 1l batteries in the s330 but expect a much shorter battery life  you also get a measley 8 mb cf card  so you need to purchase a bigger one  at least 128mb in my opinion  two cds are included with the software for the camera  i use adobe photoshop 6 right now  so i didn t try the included software i would definitely recommend buying a larger cf card  an additional battery  and a small camera carry case  remember that you cannot use type ii cf media  like the ibm microdrive  so your best bet is 128 or 256 mb cf cards  if you really want 1 2 gb and 1 gb cf cards  be forewarned that the price runs in the  400 range for a 512 mb  1 2 gb  cf card and at least  700 for a 1 gb cf card at the time i write this  you should not need more than a 256mb cf card in my opinion  the ac adapter kit might be helpful too although not necessary  but if you plan on printing directly from the camera to the supported canon printers  i would get the ac adapter  i would highly consider at least a seperate cf reader so you don t have to drain the batteries on the camera transferring images to the computer   you want more details  check out these additional sites b www imaging resource com www dpreview com both sides provide detailed looks at the camera that they review and explain features and quality of photos in severe detail  if you can t find the information you re looking for at either of these two sites  i doubt you would find it anywhere b about me and photography and the fate of the camera  i m not a photography student or even an enthusiast  i m a physician that enjoy technology and gadgets  i know the kind of quality and features i want in a camera  although i have several camera lying around the house  these camera include a canon s40  nikon coolpix 5000  canon s330  nikon coolpix 995  i just know that the quality of the pictures of s200 camera are pleasing to my eye and impress friends when i show them the photos taken by the s200 on a computer screen or developed through sites like ofoto  if you read my s200 review  then you know i first bought that camera  it was taken by my girlfriend and i got back my s110  then my brother traded his s330 for my s110  so now i have the s330 in my possession and now you re reading my review  my girlfriend enjoys the size and flexibility of the s200  my brother enjoys the size and more rugged construction of the s110  yes  i still feel that the s110 is more solidly constructed than the s200 and s330 cameras and it feels heavier than the s200  i like the s330 because it has a 3x optical zoom and a more robust feature set than the s200 camera although the s330 is a bit bulkier than the s200 s110  i guess we all got what we wanted in the end  ; if you read my  review you know how  got the  camera my brother got  good deal on this camera at

217;camera; the popularity of the canon powershot g2 has had tongues wagging for many months  if only canon would offer the advanced features and pro level performance of the g2 in a package that was like the super compact s110 and s300  oh  and at a bargain price too  then all would be right in the digital camera world  well  canon has done exactly what everyone has been clamoring for  the new canon powershot s40 offers almost all the advanced features available on the groundbreaking g2  compact size  almost as small as the powershot s300  and a bargain price  the s40 is a feature rich four megapixel digital camera that offers advanced amateurs and pro photographers a compact digital imaging machine that provides more features and creative options than most photographers will ever use   a few words about digital photography vs traditional film photography  contrary to popular belief digital photography and traditional film photography remain two separate and distinct mediums  digital photography is not going to replace traditional film photography any time in the foreseeable future  both mediums have their strengths and their weaknesses and smart photographers will dismiss the hype and hyperbole and utilize each medium to its maximum capability for the applications it is best suited for  digital photography is very convenient and it is possible to shoot digital images and utilize them only moments later  something that cannot be done with traditional 35mm film which must be processed first  digital images  with the use of image manipulation programs like adobephotoshop  are capable of much more manipulation than traditional film images  reality need not be a limiting factor for the digital photographer  who has the ability to create not only images that have never existed before  but also images that  in reality  could not possibly exist  what digital photography cannot do is show the nuances in contrast  depth of field effect  edge sharpness  bokeh  and color tonal dynamic range that traditional  especially slow slide and fine grain b w  film is capable of  the current crop of high resolution four and five megapixel digital cameras offer photographers more options than ever before  good 11x14 enlargements of uncompressed digital image files are possible for the first time with consumer level digital cameras  make no mistake digital 11x14 s will not outshine 11x14 enlargements made with slow speed slide  or fine grain b w  film  especially if they are viewed with a good quality 4x 6x loupe  slow speed slide and fine grain b w film will produce acceptable to good 16x20 enlargements  something that is not possible with digital image files at this time unless they are custom printed be careful that you don t fall into the digital photography is cheaper trap  because that argument doesn t hold any water  digital cameras can cost from 3 to 10 times as much as a similar film camera  here s an example  the nikon n65 film slr runs about  300 and the fuji finepix s1 pro digital slr  which actually has fewer features  runs about  2300  cf sm memory stick ibm microdrive storage media  the  film  for digital cameras  can add from  50 to  500 to the price of your digital camera  depending on capacity  film cameras last longer and the technology moves much more slowly  whatever digital camera you buy today is already two generations behind the cutting edge  manufacturers are in the final r d stages with the next digital camera and they are simultaneously working on the development of the successor to that model  and even more troubling are serious concerns about digital print longevity and technological obsolescence rendering digital image files un retrievable in the future b do you really need a 4 or 5 megapixel digital camera b probably not  unless you are a serious amateur photographer or a professional  if you ve been using a pro 35mm slr and pro quality zoom or prime  fixed focal length  lenses and shooting slow slide or fine grain b w film  then you are probably going to need a four or five megapixel digital to give you image quality that is comparable to what you are used to  if you ve been shooting with 35mm amateur slr s  consumer level zooms  and color print film  then you are probably going to love digital photography  and if you shoot primarily snapshots  family  friends  life events  vacation  then you probably won t need anything more than a very good 2 megapixel  or if you occasionally want 8x10 enlargements  a good 3 megapixel  point and shoot  digital camera b features  i exposure  the

the weather here in kentucky has been pretty typical for this time of year with warm pretty days followed by cold gray rainy days  my friend  who sells and distributes photographic equipment  showed up the saturday before st  patrick s day with a brand new s40 and asked if i wanted come out and play  my friend thought the compact stainless steel s40 body looked very cool and the sliding lens cover reminded him of the classic wwii minox spy camera  we tested the s40 over the course of the st  patrick s day weekend  which was cold  gray  and rainy not optimal camera testing weather  we first set up a macro stage  children  you can try this at home for directions see my review of the olympus e 20n digital camera the url is listed below  and spread out a collection of brightly colored plastic beach toys  on a white background  that we use to test digital camera color  after manually white balancing the camera we used the s40 to shoot brightly colored red  green  blue  and yellow plastic shapes  the s40 s colors were well saturated and accurate  the camera s white balance handled the test lighting pretty well  though we both noticed a very slight warm cast with the auto setting  the manual white balance setting produced the best results  the s40 had some difficulty with incandescent  yellow  lighting  without flash  but when used with the flash the incandescent setting achieved nearly neutral results in the close range  the s40 s white balance worked better than most of the current digital cameras available under artificial lighting  the s40 s performance in this test was virtually identical to the tests we had done with the canon g2  the powershot s40 takes about four seconds to extend the lens and  power up  before you can start shooting  shutter lag is quite short  but longer than 35mm shutter lag times  the raw mode is a great feature because it produces a much smaller file than the tiff image modes of other cameras  raw images from the s40 run about 2800 kb and a tiff file might run as high as 9000 kb  canon includes a raw to tiff software conversion application in the s40 s bundle b st  patrick s day  after finishing the basic color test we took the s40 outdoors to shoot some  street  shots of the colorfully clad characters returning from the st  patrick s day parade  our local st  patrick s day celebration has a much more provincial flavor than those in new york and boston  with the spectators making up for their lack of sophistication with an abundance of enthusiasm and creativity  we spent about an hour shooting revelers wandering back and forth along bardstown road between the city s irish pubs  most of which are located in the highlands  the s40 produced consistently great color images of the passionate st  paddy s day partyers  especially considering how dreary and gray the weather was  caucasian skin tones in our outdoor tests came out a little pink  but that may have been more a result of the brisk breeze and mid thirties temperatures than anything relevant to the s40 s performance  optical distortion with the excellent 3x zoom was lower than average at the wide angle end  and the telephoto setting produced virtually distortion free images  chromatic aberration  purple fringing  was noticeable but well controlled  the zoom displayed some noticeable softness in the corners of the frame  low light performance was well above average  noise in longer exposures is well controlled  even at the iso 400 setting  macro performance is very good with high resolution in close up images  the s40 s flash performance is about average for point n shoot digital cameras  a bit weak for general shooting and a little hot for macro work  the s40 is surprisingly fast  shutter lag is almost non existent  and shot to shot times are excellent   mid america trucking show  the following saturday we got together saturday afternoon to visit the mid america trucking show  the largest  trucking theme show  in the world  more than 1 000 000 square feet of the cavernous west wing of the kentucky fair and exposition center is given over to this diesel extravaganza  the show started right here in louisville in 1971 and has gown bigger every year since  the mid america trucking show draws more than 80 000 visitors to the bluegrass state every spring to see the most beautifully painted and most technologically advanced trucks on the planet  my friend and i wanted to go because we had seen some shots of some the fantastic paint jobs on these diesel behemoths in tv ads for the show  many of the fanciest trucks are entered in the paul k  young memorial truck beauty championship  young was the founder the truck show and after his death in 1998 the organizers wanted a signature event named after him  the truck beauty contest is a natural  some of the semi s entered in the contest have wonderfully complex murals that stretch the full length of the cab and trailer  just the sort of colorful stuff that is perfect for camera tests  all the illumination at the kentucky fair and exposition center is fluorescent  so the truck show provided an excellent opportunity to check out the accuracy of the s40 s white balance system  which worked beautifully  there were also many people photography opportunities with more than 80 000 attendees from all fifty states and more than forty foreign countries and over 1000 exhibitors b a few concerns  the 3x zoom lens on the s40 is not threaded for use with add on lens adapters or filters  and this a really vexing omission  the built in flash is pretty weak and canon chose not to provide any capability for using external flash  another glaring omission in a four megapixel digital camera  battery life is decent  canon says 180 200 images with constant lcd use and over 400 using only the optical viewfinder  we got a bit more than two hours of heavy use from a fully charged battery  moderate lcd use  the included 16mb standard cf card isn t going to provide enough storage for anything more than a minor event  you ll need to purchase at least one 64mb card and an additional battery to fully utilize the s40   conclusion  after we finished our tests we printed the two best st  patrick s day image pairs at 5x7 and 8x10 and two 8x10 s from the truck show on an epson stylus photo epx 785 that we ve been testing  watch for the upcoming review of this exciting  digital darkroom  tool  we then carefully inspected the printed images using a mamiya 4x loupe designed for checking medium format prints  they were as good as similar images we d printed from the g2  color  contrast  resolution  and subjective  look  were comparable to any four megapixel digital camera currently available in terms of image quality  the s40 is an excellent general use digital camera that offers users just about all the manual exposure controls they might want  but works beautifully for neophyte photographers who want to shoot creative high quality digital images without learning basic photography skills  recommended without reservation are you considering spreading your imaging wings and setting up a  digital darkroom b  check out

224;camera; as an amateur photographer who prefers a manual focus slr and prime lenses for control and picture quality  i wanted a digital camera to take snapshots and as a  backup  camera for traveling pictures  my search led to the sony dsc p71  a 3 2 megapixel camera with optional manual focus and digital settings that provide some decent options for picture taking  to my surprise  the p71 is a great little picture taker that often rivals the best of my nikon  it has a very nice feature  an autofocus illuminator  that enables the camera to focus even in the dark as long as your subject is within about ten feet  it also has very little  shutter lag  allowing you to take pictures in normal conditions quickly one after another  it has a comprehensive and simple menu that is displayed at your option on the bright and colorful lcd screen  and it allows you to format the pictures in the camera itself by zooming in and trimming as you like it  the only danger is that too much zooming will undermine the quality of your picture  you can also set it to landscape  twilight or twilight portrait mode  the last mode takes excellent photos of people at night yet still shows the city light background  it also has a 3x optical zoom that is excellent  but i do not recommend using the additional 2x digital zoom  again  this will make your pictures too grainy  another nice feature  it really feels like a camera  it s sturdy  the right size and has the lcd on the middle right where it should be  this way your left thumb can rest where it belongs  on the left side of the camera  too many digitals have the lcd screens on the left where your thumb belongs the initial memory  stick  of 16 megabytes is inadequate  i bought a 64 mg that holds 40 3 megapixel photos at one time  the provided battery charger is slow  it takes at least ten hours to charge  i bought a  one hour  charger that will recharge two backups in about 90 minutes  with these optional purchases the p71 is a complete package the p71 is made for connectivity  it has a usb port to a computer and a video out that allows you to put on a slide show directly from your camera  very nice  and the memory stick can be plugged directly into most printers today  it also has an adapter slot to connect to your wall to save batteries there are  of course  some negatives  there is no external flash  the internal flash is superior for a point and shoot camera  but a through the lens external flash would be better  there is no sound even for the movie mode  so don t get it if you want this to be your video camera  also  the pixel software for showing and adjusting your pictures is almost incomprehensible  the help brings up instructions but they are unclear and at times incomprehensible  the adjustment features are rudimentary and the interface with windows is terrible  the one time i did call pixela service for help i got a very nice live person almost immediately  but the software still stinks  thank goodness i already had adobe photoshop on my computer if you want a great digital camera that takes fantastic snapshots  that s compact and easy to use  then consider the 3 2 megapixel p71  it s all you will ever need and it s very quick for a digital camera  if you want movie sound  full manual controls  changeable lenses  external flash or to print out still shots larger than 8 x 10  consider a digital slr or the sony dsc 85  for most amateurs this is all the digital camera you will ever need  ; as an amateur photographer who prefers  manual focus sir and prime lenses for control and picture quality  wanted  digital camera to take snapshots and as  back camera for traveling pictures my search led to the sonya duc   megapixel camera with optional manual focus and digital settings that provide some decent option for picture taking to my surprise the  is  great little picture take that often rivals the best of my union it has  very nice feature an autofocus illuminated that enables the camera to focus even in the dark as long as your subject is within about ten feet it also has very little shutter law allowing you to take pictures in normal conditions quickly one after another it has  comprehensive and simple menu that is displayed at your option on the bright and colourful led screen and it allows you to format the pictures in the camera itself by booming in and trimming as you like it the only danger is that too much booming will undermine the quality of your picture you can also set it to landscape twilight or twilight portrait mode the last mode takes excellent photo of people at night yet still shows the city light background it also has   optical room that is excellent but  do not recommend using the additional  digital room again this will make your pictures too grain another nice feature it really feels like  camera it  sturdy the right size and has the led on the middle right where it should be this way your left thumb can rest where it belongs on the left side of the camera too many digital have the led screens on the left where your thumb belongs the initial memory stick of megabytes is inadequate  bought  my that holds megapixel photo at one time the provided battery charge is slow it takes at least ten hours to charge  bought  one hour charge that will charge two backs in about minutes with these optional purchases the  is  complete package the  is made for conductivity it has  us port to  computer and  video out that allows you to put on  slide show directly from your camera very nice and the memory stick can be plugged directly into most printers today it also has an adapted slot to connect to your wall to save batteries there are of course some negative there is no external flash the internal flash is superior for  point and shoot camera but  through the lens external flash would be better there is no sound even for the movie mode so don  get it if you want this to be your video camera also the fixed software for showing and adjusting your pictures is almost incomprehensible the help brings up instructions but they are unclear and at times incomprehensible the adjustment features are rudimentary and the interface with windows is terrible the one time  did call pixela service for help  got  very nice live person almost immediately but the software still sticks thank goodness  already had adore photoshop on my computer if you want  great digital camera that takes fantastic snapshots that  compact and easy to use then consider the megapixel  it  all you will ever need and it  very quick for  digital camera if you want movie sound full manual controls changeable lenses external flash or to print out still shots larger than  consider  digital sir or the sonya duc for most amateur this is all the digital camera you will ever need

230;camera; hello all  it s been a while since i wrote an epinion  i have a few new digicams to write about  this epinion is about my  newest  aquisition  i work for staples here in n e  pa ans one day a customer came in with an old digital camera he got on ebay  it was in a bundle pack of cameras he bid on   he wanted an olympus cam that was in the pack  he had this other cam that was in there  he wanted to see if it worked  and if it did he was giving it to his pastor  anyway it worked  and had me interested  i went online to look at this cam and see what it s specs were  it seemed interesting  and the more i read the more i wanted one  so off to ebay i went  took a while to win on one  seems they are very popular now  used to be a  1 000 00 camera in it s day  1997  they now go for between  20 00 and  100 00  give or take  i got mine for  36 00 with shipping and insurance  paypal  it arrived as they said it would  as is  no books  no software  and no cables  just the camera  i put in 4 ni mh aa batteries  and a 16 mb compact flash card that i had here  and turned the play switch on  it came on  so far so good  i turned it off  and slid the on switch for taking pics to the open side  exposing the front of the viewfinder  and the flash sensor  and powering the cam  it made some noises and the rear lcd came to life  telling me i had around 60 pics  was set to best mode  has 4 levels of quality  good  better  best   and uncompressed  which actually still has some compression actually  kodak lied about a few things back then  i ll get to more on this later  anyway  i anxiously aimed the cam at one of my cats  and pressed the shutter down 1 2 way  the cam focused  and the ready light blinked  i pressed the rest of the way  the flash went off  and the cam saved the pic  i went back to the playback  and the pic came up on screen  it worked   smiles  so i got a working one  and in good shape too  only a little dust inside the lens  time to experiment  smiles  well  first the main specs of the cam  and i ll mention where kodak lied  resolution 1280x960  making this a 1 2mp cam  actual chip resolution 850x984  or 836 400 pixels  so in fact this isn t a megapixel cam as kodak claimed  ahh well  for me no big deal  as i allready knew this memory  built in  2 mb  also takes cf cards  up to at least 128 mb that i tested 24 bit color depth iso equivalent of iso 160  so it s just about a good all around cam 3x optical zoom  no digital zoom auto focus 2 3 ft to infinity  using ir for focusing close up focus 0 7 feet to 1 6 feet  0 2 to 0 5 m zoom length 38mm to 114 mm 35 mm cam equivalent  actual focal length 7mm to 21 mm flash range on wide  2 3 ft to 16 4 feet  on tele 2 3 ft to 10 8 feet aperture  wide f 2 5 to f 16 tele f 3 8 to f 24 shutter speed  one of the things i liked  1 500th to 16 seconds  great for night shots viewfinder zooming optical  now like i said  i only got the cam  nothing else  but i do have card readers for cf cards  so no biggie  i put the card in to the reader  and checked the pics  kodak used a different picture file format here  it ends with a  kdc  it s actually a form of  jpg  i know because the hp photosmart printers we have at work will let you see the pic  but on thre it looks blurry  minor differences make it unuseable this way right from the cam  normally i d have been stuck without the conversion software kodak uses  but luckily you can dl it from kodak  or use any other program that reads  kdc format  paint shop pro 7 does  as does irfanview  for examples  the cam saves all pics in the 1280x960 resolution  interpolating them up from 850x960  so they look a little soft  not sharp  a little resizing to 850x637  which is what they are when you try to match the resolution horizontaly  without loosing the aspect ratio helps to sharpen the pics up  as does using the sharpening controls of your favorite photo editor  once you save the file as a  jpg or whatever you like  i find that irfanview s sharpening filter or photoshops unsharp mask work best  making the pics useable for web and also printing  up to 5x7 depending on the pic  i have been taking this cam everywhere with me  along with my other new cam  my toshiba pdr 3300 3 2 mp  they both have good and bad sides and work well as a combo  the dc120 will focus in any light even darkness  since it uses ir  the toshiba uses edge detection  so the subject has to have some light on it for focus  this cam is not hard to use once you figure the controls out  it can be used 1 handed  once you set the zoom  there is a hand strap on the right side  like a camcorder  keeping the cam on your hand well  you don t use the viewscreen on back to set up the shot  you can  but it works better if you don t  and saves batteries  there are some bad parts to this cam  for one  it s a discontinued cam  so no support really from kodak  2 you have to buy them used  so who knows what condition they will be in  but the price is usually good there can be defects on the cam  for example  mine has a slight problem with hot pixels showing up on dark photos  hot pixels look liek white specks in the pic  not a major prob  unless taking pics of a starry sky  smiles  mine also has dust inside the lens  so far i don t think it s affected the pics  when taking pics in the highest quality mode  it takes about 10 seconds to save the pic  and be ready for the next one  so it s a bit slow  just plan your shots right  smiles  some features i liked  and also made me get one of these were  when shooting close up mode  the display comes on when you hold the shuter down 1 2 way  letting you see the pic better than using the viewfinder  also  when in close up mode you manually focus the cam  using the zoom buttons  also shows the distance focused for on the little lcd  this is the only time the cam has manual focus  but i still like it  i liek the shape of it  it is the size of a good sized paperback novel  and you use it looking down the longest part of the cam  like binoculars sort of it s not a heavy cam  has a big lens  letting in more light it seems  and i been told it uses a ccd imaging chip as opposed to a cmos chip like the cheaper cams now use  allowing for better color reproduction  i have gotten some very nice pictures from this cam  you can still get add on lenses and filters for this cam used and new  check with tiffen  i love the ir focus system  hasn t really failed me yet  and seems right on the money when it focuses  now  don t get me wrong  this cam isn t as good as my toshiba pdr 3300 for serious pictures  the 3 2 mp images are very sharp  but it makes a nice 2nd cam  replacing my other cams i reviewed in previous epinions for the most part  i for one am very happy with this cam  and would suggest that anyone interested in a very inexpensive cam to play around with  check ebay and try to get one  unless you get a defective unit  you won t be disapointed  that s all for now  if you have any questions or comments  please submit them here  or e mail at jbach37 yahoo com and again  thank you for reading  john ; hello all it  been  while since  wrote an opinion  have  few new

and no tables just the camera  put in ni my a batteries and  mb compact flash card that  had here and turned the play switch on it came on so far so good  turned it off and slid the on switch for taking pick to the open side exposing the front of the viewfinder and the flash senior and lowering the can it made some noise and the rear led came to life telling me  had around pick was set to best mode has levels of quality good better best and compressed which actually still has some compression actually today lied about  few things back then  ll get to more on this later anyway  anxiously aimed the can at one of my cats and pressed the shutter down way the can focused and the ready light blinked  pressed the rest of the way the flash went off and the can saved the pick  went back to the playback and the pick came up on screen it worked smiles so  got  working one and in good shape too only  little dust inside the lens time to experiment smiles well first the main speck of the can and  ll mention where today lied resolution  making this  up can actual chip resolution  or pipes so in fact this isn   megapixel can as today claimed ah well for me no big deal as  already knew this memory built in mb also takes cf cards up to at least mb that  tested bit color depth iso equivalent of iso so it  just about  good all around can  optical room no digital room auto focus ft to infinity using in for rousing close up focus feet to feet to  room length mm to mm mm can equivalent actual local length mm to mm flash range on wide ft to feet on tell ft to feet aperture wide  to  tell  to  shutter speed one of the things  liked th to seconds great for night shots viewfinder booming optical now like  said  only got the can nothing else but  do have card readers for cf cards so no bigger  put the card in to the reader and checked the pick today used  different picture file format here it ends with  do it  actually  form of pg  know because the he photosmart printers we have at work will let you see the pick but on the it looks flurry minor differences make it unstable this way right from the can normally   have been stuck without the conversion software today uses but luckily you can do it from today or use any other program that reads do format paint shop pro does as does irfanview for examples the can saves all pick in the  resolution interpolating them up from  so they look  little soft not sharp  little residing to  which is what they are when you try to match the resolution horizontal without looking the aspect ratio helps to sharpen the pick up as does using the sharpening controls of your favorite photo editor once you save the file as  pg or whatever you like  find that irfanview  sharpening filter or photoshops sharp mask work best making the pick unable for web and also printing up to  depending on the pick  have been taking this can everywhere with me along with my other new can my toshiba per up they both have good and bad sides and work well as  comb the do will focus in any light even darkness since it uses in the toshiba uses edge detection so the subject has to have some light on it for focus this can is not hard to use once you figure the controls out it can be used handed once you set the room there is  hand strap on the right side like  camcorder keeping the can on your hand well you don  use the viewscreen on back to set up the shot you can but it works better if you don  and saves batteries there are some bad parts to this can for one it   discontinued can so no support really from today you have to buy them used so who knows what condition they will be in but the price is usually good there can be defects on the can for example mine has  slight problem with hot pipes showing up on dark photo hot pipes look like white speaks in the pick not  major probe unless taking pick of  starry sky smiles mine also has dust inside the lens so far  don  think it  affected the pick when taking pick in the highest quality mode it takes about seconds to save the pick and be ready for the next one so it   bit slow just plan your shots right smiles some features  liked and also made me get one of these were when shooting close up mode the display comes on when you hold the shutter down way letting you see the pick better than using the viewfinder also when in close up mode you mentally focus the can using the room buttons also shows the distance focused for on the little led this is the only time the can has manual focus but  still like it  like the shape of it it is the size of  good sized paperback novel and you use it looking down the longest part of the can like binoculars sort of it  not  heavy can has  big lens letting in more light it seems and  been told it uses  cod imagine chip as opposed to  cos chip like the cheaper came now use allowing for better color reproduction  have gotten some very nice pictures from this can you can still get add on lenses and filters for this can used and new check with stiffen  love the in focus system hasn  really failed me yet and seems right on the money when it focused now don  get me wrong this can isn  as good as my toshiba per for serious pictures the up images are very sharp but it makes  nice nd can replacing my other came  reviewed in previous opinions for the most part  for one am very happy with this can and would suggest that anyone interested in  very expensive can to play around with check bay and try to get one unless you get  defective unit you won  be disappointed that  all for now if you have any questions or comments please submit them here or  mail at back yakov com and again thank you for reading john

237;camera; my history i blindly purchased my first digital camera  a kodak  four years ago by ordering one off the internet because my rural town didn t have any digital cameras in stock  i choose the kodak dc 240 1 3 mp camera  i was thrilled with it  when i showed people my photos  they raved they looked like magazine photos  i thought i was a good photographer   amazingly though   it wasn t me   it was all kodak  now  having tried many other cameras   i know i was blessed when i blindly chose kodak for many reasons in my pursuit to buy a new camera  i blindly sent away for another kodak  except this time i got a bomb  i bought the dx3900  and it was so bad   i immediately put it up for auction on e bay  i was so disappointed i can t even begin to say  next i bought the latest and greatest nikon 5000 camera  i set it up to  point and shoot  and whoa i was so disappointed  mind you this is a top of the line slr 5mp camera with an 8x optical zoom   but it just didn t take quality photos in point and shoot mode  the shutter lag was insane  i often missed my subjects it was sooo slow  the lens hunted around in blur mode half the time  i couldn t take it  my old kodak was quick  for the money  1100  i felt robbed  i quickly returned it next  i bought the minolta s404  i tried it out at target and thankfully  the shutter lag was more tolerable and the hunting mode   while still present   wasn t quite as bad as the nikon  i figured it was less complex and might be able to meet my needs  i bought it and took it home  sadly  all the photos were dark  there was no software worth speaking about either with the minolta  they seemed to have taken shortcuts compared to kodak  i was paying more and getting less  none of the photos looked like the magazine photos i used to know with my kodak  the color was pathetic   even after using their software to improve it  upon reviewing photos at several sites like www imaging resources   i realized the minotla was a flawed camera too  it didn t hold a candle to my old kodak  i immediately returned it the kodak dx4330 ahh and then i saw the newest camera come out by kodak on kodak s site and i had to try it  i ran out to circuit city and tried it  the shutter lag and auto focus hunting are my biggest complaint with most cameras  they are sooooo slow  when i tried the new kodak dx4330   wow   it was great   like my old dc240  i purchased it and took it home  i was reserved but excited i quickly unwrapped it  and snapped a few photos  i never even opened up the manual and i quickly and intuitively figured out how to download the photos via the usb cable provided  this camera is great for anyone   the learning curve is zero  the first pictures were simply amazing  smashingly beautiful and as my first friend who saw the first photo said   they look like magazine photos  yes  kodak did it again i am not going to spend time reviewing the features of the camera  you can do that by clicking on the  specs  or by going to the manufacturers page  i will tell you this is a 3 1 mp camera with little manual override features that competes with the best of them in quality  color and accuracy  you can blow up photos to 11x14 with incredible quality i can take sunsets and get fabulous color  which the minolta could not do no matter what the setting  i can get great night shots outside with the porch light on and i can take great photos indoors or outside  again the minolta failed on the indoor shots  you can also take fabulous macro shots   again this camera beat the minolta hands down  i didn t test the nikon on this the color is nearly perfect as well  again minolta couldn t capture cherry red  take a photo and compare it to reality   you ll be impressed  kodak also supplies some great software with it too which allows you to crop  color adjust  covert to black n white  balance light dark  enhance  eliminate red eye  etc  the software is slick   quick and easy the camera is small  very light weight and the 2 aa batteries last for 180   shots using the flash and the review mode to see photos after they are taken  the storage media is secure digital so far  no complaints about that either the date stamp isn t the greatest as it is rather large and bright yellow   but it is there if you want it  there is no time stamp the software which comes with the camera is pleasing  it serves all my needs though i don t like the way kodak makes you save photos to e mail people  i use another software to downsize the images  you also can t rename them using kodak s software which is a flaw   but minor to live with  when you save photos to your hard drive  kodak automatically files them in a folder with the date  you can override this and create your own naming conventions the downloading via the usb is amazingly quick and very simple  you can t mess it up  it s all intuitive  you can see a little thumbnail of each photo being downloaded which is great  then when they are all downloaded  kodak s software lets you view the photos in full screen slideshow mode i recently blew up the  first photo  i took with this camera as it was that pleasing   to an 11 x 14   and it looks professional the quality that is good this is a must buy  if you are thinking about it   don t  get one today  you won t regret it if you are a novice or anyone who doesn t want to bother with all the old 35mm pre sets  the camera can easily fit into a purse and off you go to shoot  i average about 400 photos a week now  there is some blue casting on brightly lit shots   its the only negative i have seen   but compared to what i saw in other cameras   i ll gladly keep it happy camera hunting  ; my history  blandly purchased my first digital camera  today four years ago by ordering one off the internet

the camera is small very light weight and the a batteries last for shots using the flash and the review mode to see photo after they are taken the storage media is secure digital so far no complaints about that either the date stamp isn  the greatest as it is rather large and bright yellow but it is there if you want it there is no time stamp the software which comes with the camera is pleasing it serves all my needs though  don  like the way today makes you save photo to  mail people  use another software to downsize the images you also can  renamed them using today  software which is  flaw but minor to live with when you save photo to your hard drive today automatically files them in  older with the date you can overrule this and create your own naming conventions the downloading via the us is amazingly quick and very simple you can  mess it up it  all intuition you can see  little thumbnail of each photo being download which is great then when they are all download today  software lets you view the photo in full screen slideshow mode  recently blew up the first photo  took with this camera as it was that pleasing to an  and it looks professional the quality that is good this is  must buy if you are thinking about it don  get one today you won  regret it if you are  novice or anyone who doesn  want to bother with all the old mm pre sets the camera can easily fit into  purse and off you go to shoot  average about photo  week now there is some blue casting on brightly lit shots its the only negative  have seen but compared to what  saw in other camera  ll gladly keep it happy camera hunting

240;camera; the sony dsc p20 was my second digital camera  i ve used it for six months  the camera itself is relatively small  not too small and not oversized like low end kodak or hp models  at first glance  the camera looks to be another great quality product from sony  after you use it and look at the picture quality it s a different story  here are the details the specs the dsc p20 is a 1 3 megapixel camera  it takes pictures at 1280x960 maximum resoultion  it also has 512x384  640x480  and 1024x768 resolutions  the features include a count down timer  red eye reudction  integrated flash  1 5  color lcd screen  and viewfinder  the dsc p20 uses sony s popular memory stick format  which currently sells from 2mb to 128mb sticks  the camera is made of durable plastic  and uses a usb connection to link to the pc  the camera also uses 2 aa batteries or the optional sony npfs11 infolithium ion batteries  not included  if you decide to use regular aa batteries the battery life is only 20   30 minutes total or about 12 shots with the flash  some people have reported even less  i was using 2 aa nimh 1800mah batteries and they lasted about 1 hour total  using the npfs11 lithium ion will last you 2 5 hours  the dsc p20 comes with 3x digital zoom and no optical zoom  i found the images to be slightly degraded when i used the zoom up to 3x but its hardly noticiable  the camera also comes with different picture effects such as black white  solarize  sepia  and negative modes  the camera saves images as  tiff  jpeg  or gif  it also takes mpeg movies  no sound  at 320x240 or 160x120  the camera also has a  macro  feature which will sharpen and focus in on images that are 3 feet or closer  the sony dsc p20 is loaded with features the package there are not many accessories that are included with the dsc p20  included in the box are  2 sony aa batteries  wont last you very long  camera wrist strap  the most useful item included in the box  and a 4mb sony memory stick  only lets you store 6   10 jpeg full size shots at full resolution  also included are the manuals and software drivers cd rom  and usb transfer cable  i suggest that you either go purchase some good 1800mah nimh rechargable batteries because alkaline batteries will not last very long  this camera has extremly low battery life  or if you are rich  you can buy the npfs11 infolithium battery for  89 99 cad or  60 00 usd  also you might also want to get a 32mb or higher memory stick  i had a 64mb memory stick which stored 118 jpegs shots at full quality and higest resolution  or 36 tiff uncompressed shots  or 11 minutes of mpeg video  the package does not include a camera bag  which i recommend if you want to carry the camera around often  also not included is the optional ac adapter for the camera  optional accessory packages like the sony acccspw for dsc p20  dsc p30  and dsc p50  includes the npfs11 battery pack  carrying case and ac adapter charger  the accessory package is around  75 00 usd or  145 00 cad the pros in detail the sony dsc p20 is relatively cheap compared to other sony digital cameras  you can probably get it for even cheaper than  200us since it is a 2001 model  also this camera acts as a memory stick drive  this is an excellent feature  you can transfer any kind of files to and from your memory stick like a removable hard drive  also this camera is very easy to use  i didnt even need to read the manual and i figured out all the features etc the cons in detail the biggest con about this camera is the picture quality  the picture quality is not as good as it should be  and it is absolutely horrible in low light conditions  the pictures are usually fine in outdoor light  however indoor light may have undesirable results such as  slight discoloration  and sometimes grainy pixels  in low light conditions the camera is especially bad  because the integrated flash is relatively weak  also the red eye reduction will not work properly sometimes  the dsc p20 s lcd screen scratches quite easily  and needs a camera bag if you are likely to get it scratched  another major con is obviously the battery life using standard aa batteries  this camera has the worst battery life i have ever seen  i used up the 2 aa batteries that were included in the box in 15minutes  i was only testing all the features and playing with the camera when i got a low battery warning do i still own this camera  no if you want a sony digital camera i would suggest a newer more mid level sony camera  it ll be more expensive but it will be worth it if you want a excellent quality low cost digital camera  check out the canon a30 or a40 both are loaded with features and excellent picture quality  see my review on the canon a30  the camera i m using now  ;

244;camera; comparison  i compared five 5m cameras before settling on the nikon 5400  film wise i ve dabbled with photography for quite a while  starting with an olympus xa1  and i ve had a canon eos 1000f slr for 12 years  i bought an olympus d 540l some time ago  which is 0 75m camera  it s taken some nice pics but as you re probably aware these won t print out at more than 3  x 2  since film photography is expensive and frustrating if you don t have your own development equipment  digital photography is the way to go  my opinion is you need a 4 5m camera to replace a 35mm camera  full manual override is a must as well the cameras i looked at    canon g5   sony v1   olympus c5050   nikon 5700   nikon 5400 a good way to compare features is to go to http www dpreview com  the  buying guide  menu and choose  side by side  a lot of the features are similar and it s pretty close these days between the manufacturers  visual quality of the cameras is improving at a marked rate and it s difficult to choose between them here  the cameras do have certain features that have pros and cons and this is where you draw your final conclusion  here is my summary of the 5 cameras listed above    canon g5   when you hold this in the shop next to the 5400 and v1 it feels like a brick  it is large and bulky  but all the features are easily accessible and it doesn t feel fiddly  personally i think this has the worst artifacts out of all the cameras listed above  colour balance and tone are great but if you look at the resolution test  on comparion  you ll see that diagonals are aliased and there are slight green fringes to black edges  conclusion  i decided against this camera because of its size and artifacts    sony v1   this is the most compact of the above cameras and for has the massive plus of a carl zeiss lens  i used to have an olympus xa1  which was a compact point and click 35mm camera  which also had a carl zeiss lens  i think it took some of the best pictures i ve ever taken  looking at the results on this site  this camera takes excellent pictures and sony seem to have sorted out the colour balancing on this model  it is nice and compact and has an automatic lens cover which is a nice feature  it s size is both a plus and a minus though  if you have large hands i don t think you ll like this camera  it is not easy to hold  it has some interesting features  like you can take pictures in complete darkness using it s infra red mode  it will also focus perfectly in the dark  compared to the other cameras is is quite cheap  but then you have to use more expensive sony memory cards and you have to buy sony attachements  e g  external flash  this is the only camera which doesn t have moveable screen   and you ll wish you did have one once you ve had a camera that has this feature  conclusion  i decided against this camera because it was so awkward to hold in the shop and the menus seemed a bit fiddly to select option settings  also it doesn t have a moveable viewing screen and you must buy sony accessories    olympus c5050   this camera is the oldest of the ones above i believe  i ve been quite impressed with my old olympus 540l  despite it s low resolution and age i think it take pretty good pictures  i think olympus are a little underrated personally as sony  nikon and canon seem to get all the attention  this camera is supposed to be very good in low light  and i like twilight photography so i did consider this camera  it feels good in your hand taking photos and the image quality is excellent  just look at the comparions  conclusion  i decided against this model as it s been out quite a while and i think the imaging software has moved on since then  it moves at a very rapid pace  the reviews point out some arifacts and i d rather not have those  despite getting at recommended rating    nikon 5700   this camera gets good reviews  it feels nice to hold  it has good functionality and takes excellent photos  it has an 8x optical zoom  which is fantastic  but because of this the camera feels more like an slr as it larger than the others  this camera is more expensive than the others but has all their features and the zoom  conclusion  if you want a camera with big zoom  i d look at some of the cheaper olympus models  there s an old maxim in photography  if you want to zoom in on a subject move closer to it  if you get a big zoom and you don t have good light you re just going to get camera shake  you even start to notice it on some of the 3x and 4x zoom models  this is a great camera  but just not quite what i was looking for    nikon 5400   i think this has the same body as the 5700 but with a 28 116mm equivalent lens  when i had my canon eos 1000f  it came with a 35 80mm lens  i soon changed this for a 28 70mm lens because more often than not you use wide angle than zoom  when you do need zoom 3 or 4 times is plenty  you rarely need 8x or 10x optical zoom and when you do you can sacrifice a little quality and do it digitally  so as you can probably tell this sold the camera to me  other than that  the camera feel great to hold  has a good rubber grip  and you can practically operate it with one hand  the fold out screen is excellent and allows you to lift it up high  or down on the ground and still see what you are taking  conclusion  wide angle lens with 4x zoom  good to hold and excellent images  i will say this camera is a little slow to process you photos once taken and isn t great at focussing in  really  bad light summary well  i hope this information has been useful to you  this is the kind of review i was looking for when trying to decide what to purchase  if you are budding photo enthusiast and you take a lot of photos and like to experiment with your camera i would avoid the sony as it s very fiddly   just try it in a shop  it also has no fold out screen  which also means it could get scratched as it has a soft plastic cover  i take it this is the main difference why this camera is cheaper  all the other cameras are much nicer to handle although the 5700 is larger  i like to go out on my bike and take photos and the 5700 won t fit in a  large jacket waterproof  pocket whereas the others will  the olympus c5050 and canon g5 probably take the worst photos of the 5 due to noise and aliasing in the images  the nikons are more expensive but feel like good solid camera and have all the features you ll ever need  the nikon cameras are the most expensive  but you can get good comparative deals if you shop around  you ll read in a number of reviews that the 5400 low light focus is a little sketchy   although it has to be pretty low light  the thing that sells it is the wide angle  go out and takes some panorama shots with it  or interiors and you ll be sold my impressions of using the nikon 5400  i m very happy with the pictures from my 5400  granted it s a big leap up from the olympus model i had before  i m having great fun with time lapse photography  and shutter priority  metering is excellent on this camera  i ve had it a couple of weeks now and taken 1000 pictures and i still feel i m only scratching the surface of all the features  definitely get a 256mb card if you get one of these cameras  don t frustrate yourself with anything less copying 256mb onto a pc takes about 5 10 mins over usb  i think you can get flash readers which might be faster than this  it s still not a long time though considering the amount of data  my 540l would take 20 mins to do 16mb over the serial link you can pretty much work the 5400 with one hand  the dials are excellent and i wouldn t buy a camera that doesn t have dial mode selector after having my canon eos 1000f  i found the rear mounted cursor buttons too low  the rear controls should be further up the camera to be more comfortable with the buttons in an arc around the cursor  following the sweep of your thumb  the rubber grip is good though and it s comfortable to take lots of photos the fold out screen is a big plus  although a little small  i take it you have to compromise in order to have better battery life  if you are using the camera a lot in one day it ll be lucky to see the day out so you should invest in a second battery  these take 2 hours to fully charge with the charger provided software that comes with the camera is pretty good  the nikon view camera software is fully featured and scaleable  will work comfortably whatever the power of your pc  you can do just about anything to a photo with the photoshop elements package that it comes with  that s real fun and why digital photography is definitely the future  i have an hp5550 photo printer which gives great results as well  note  get a printer which prints full page as the 5550 has a white border  for best results you should go to a professional printers where they ll have 20 grand professional printer   you get better results enjoy nick ; comparison  compared five  camera before settling on the union film wise  ve doubled with photography for quite  while starting with an polypus a and  ve had  canon os  sir for years  bought an polypus   some time ago which is  camera it  taken some nice pick but as you re probably aware these won  print out at more than  since film photography is expensive and frustration if you don  have your own development equipment digital photography is the way to go my opinion is you need   camera to replace  mm camera full manual overrule is  must as well the camera  looked at canon  sonya  polypus  union union  good way to compare features is to go to http www review com the buying guide menu and choose side by side  lot of the features are similar and it  pretty close these days between the manufacturers visual quality of the camera is improving at  marked rate and it  difficult to choose between them here the camera do have certain features that have pro and sons and this is where you draw your final conclusion here is my summary of the camera listed above canon  when you hold this in the shop next to the and  it feels like  brick it is large and bulky but all the features are easily accessible and it doesn  feel fiddle personally  think this has the worst artifacts out of all the camera listed above colour balance and tone are great but if you look at the resolution test on companion you ll see that diagonal are pleased and there are slight green fringes to black edges conclusion  decided against this camera because of its size and artifacts sonya  this is the most compact of the above camera and for has the massive plus of  carl less lens  used to have an polypus a which was  compact point and click mm camera which also had  carl less lens  think it took some of the best pictures  ve ever taken

cards and you have to buy sonya attachments   external flash this is the only camera which doesn  have movable screen and you ll wish you did have one once you ve had  camera that has this feature conclusion  decided against this camera because it was so awkward to hold in the shop and the venus seemed  bit fiddle to select option settings also it doesn  have  movable viewing screen and you must buy sonya accessories polypus  this camera is the oldest of the ones above  believe  ve been quite impressed with my old polypus  despite it  low resolution and age  think it take pretty good pictures  think polypus are  little underrated personally as sonya union and canon seem to get all the attention this camera is supposed to be very good in low light and  like twilight photography so  did consider this camera it feels good in your hand taking photo and the image quality is excellent just look at the companions conclusion  decided against this model as it  been out quite  while and

gets good reviews it feels nice to hold it has good functionality and takes excellent photo it has an  optical room which is fantastic but because of this the camera feels more like an sir as it larger than the others this camera is more expensive than the others but has all their features and the room conclusion if you want  camera with big room   look at some of the cheaper polypus models there  an old maxim in photography if you want to room in on  subject move closer to it if you get  big room and you don  have good light you re just going to get camera shake you even start to notice it on some of the  and  room models this is  great camera but just not quite what  was looking for union  think this has the same body as the but with  mm equivalent lens when  had my canon os  it

245;camera; my wife is an avid 35mm camera buff and is still not sold on digital photography  well i came across a good deal on a polaroid pdc 1300 camera and despite some shortcomings  i am quite impressed of what you get for the price first of all  windows xp users may be a bit frustrated  the camera will not work with the simple and easy to use  built in  digital camera software that works so well with scanners and other input devices  so  you have to install the polaroid software though a compatibility wizard  it installs but i was unable to use the usb cord  so i had to go with the much slower  seems like it  serial plug  a good solution would be to spend a little extra money and get a universal compactflash reader that works like a disk device in windows xp  makes it much easier now  on to the camera  it takes really good pictures  they are clear and crisp at all resolutions  the only bad picture i had was when i was taking pictures outside at dusk  they seemed to be quite dull  there isn t an adequate zoom on the camera  so you really have to move in to fill the frame  the lcd screen and the menu options work quite well and are an added bonus for the low cost to the camera  the included software is pretty basic but if basic is what you want  xp s software is much easier and faster to use  windows 95 98 me users will have no problems installing the software the camera consumes the batteries quite quickly  so be sure to turn it off when not in use  the lcd screen also eats a lot of power  when the batteries are low  there really is no warning and when you go to take a picture  it will flash and then turn off  i would recommend taking a pocketful of batteries with you on trips  it also includes a usb and serial cord  a protective case and an 8 meg card  i would recommend getting at least a 32 meg card  overall  if you can find this camera for under  200 00  it is a great price and very good for basic use  those wanting more features are better off with one with more  bells and whistles  ; my wife is an aid mm camera buff and is still not sold on digital photography well  came across  good deal on  polaroid do camera and despite some shortcomings  am quite impressed of what you get for the price first of all windows up users may be  bit frustrated the camera will not work with the simple and easy to use built in digital camera software that works so well with manners and other input devices so you have to install the polaroid software though  incompatibility wizard it installs but  was unable to use the us cord so  had to go with the much slower seems like it aerial plug  good solution would be to spend  little extra money and get  universal compactflash reader that works like  disk device in windows up makes it much easier now on to the camera it takes really good pictures they are clear and crisp at all resolutions the only bad picture  had was when  was taking pictures outside at dusk they seemed to be quite dull there isn  an adequate room on the camera so you really have to move in to fill the frame the led screen and the menu option work quite well and are an added bonus for the low cost to the camera the included software is pretty basic but if basic is what you want up  software is much easier and faster to use windows me users will have no problems installing the software the camera consumed the batteries quite quickly so be sure to turn it off when not in use the led screen also eats  lot of power when the batteries are low there really is no warning and when you go to take  picture it will flash and then turn off  would recommend taking  pocketful of batteries with you on trips it also includes  us and aerial cord  protective case and an meg card  would recommend getting at least  meg card overall if you can find this camera for under it is  great price and very good for basic use those wanting more features are better off with one with more bells and whistles

249;camera; this is a good digital camera for someone wanting to get into digital photography  it s easy to use  the shape and feel of the camera is very much like a traditional non digital point and shoot as you might expect from kodak  the images themselves are quite good the biggest downfall of this camera is that there s no optical zoom  the digital zoom is difficult to use  since it s not optical  you have to use the display screen when shooting with it to see what you ll really get   you can t tell by using the viewfinder  this makes it quite difficult for outdoor shots where the screen can be tough to see  the camera will also go through the battery power more quickly when using the display screen  and even at only 3x the zoom makes the picture quite grainy and pixelated  so i pretty much gave up on using it and considered it to be a camera with no zoom the dx3600 is not much more  but it does have an optical zoom   not much  but enough to make it much more useful than the 3500  my suggestion if you get this camera is to not use the zoom  even if it looks like it would make a better shot  instead  shoot without it  then crop the photo later on your pc  you ll avoid the pixelation problem  and if you shoot at the highest resolution  you ll still have a decent size photo  especially if it s for sharing via the web or e mail  but even small prints will be okay also be aware that replacing the batteries can get expensive  i suggest purchasing a charger and rechargable battery pack  that does  of course  offset one of the nice benefits of this camera   the price i used this camera for a few weeks then sold it on ebay and used the money for a dx3600  you can find both models regularly on ebay as factory refurbs  although most were probably never even used    but don t get too carried away with the bidding  as i ve seen some of them go for almost the price of new ones  ; this is  good digital camera for someone wanting to get into digital photography it  easy to use the shape and feel of the camera is very much like  traditional non digital point and shoot as you might expect from today the images themselves are quite good the biggest downfall of this camera is that there  no optical room the digital room is difficult to use since it  not optical you have to use the display screen when shooting with it to see what you ll really get you can  tell by using the viewfinder this makes it quite difficult for outdoor shots where the screen can be tough to see the camera will also go through the battery power more quickly when using the display screen and even at only  the room makes the picture quite grain and pixelated so  pretty much gave up on using it and considered it to be  camera with no room the do is not much more but it does have an optical room not much but enough to make it much more useful than the my suggestion if you get this camera is to not use the room even if it looks like it would make  better shot instead shoot without it then crop the photo later on your pp you ll avoid the pixelation problem and if you shoot at the highest resolution you ll still have  decent size photo especially if it  for sharing via the web or  mail but even small prints will be okay also be aware that replacing the batteries can get expensive  suggest purchasing  charge and rechargable battery pack that does of course offset one of the nice benefits of this camera the price  used this camera for  few weeks then sold it on bay and used the money for  do you can find both models regularly on bay as factory returns although most were probably never even used but don  get too carried away with the bidding as  ve seen some of them go for almost the price of new ones

258;auto; mercedes benz is a legendary name in the auto industry  renowned for its exceptional quality and engineering  but does that mean the three pointed star is immune to rolling out an occasional lemon  is it possible for mercedes benz to build a clunker yes virginia  m b is indeed capable of building a clunker  we know because we own one  we leased a new 1999 ml 320 in october  1998 and were immediately surprised by some very un mercedes like rattles  squeaks and shakes  the ml felt much looser than our other sport utility vehicle  a 1997 jeep grand cherokee  this came as something of a shock  considering how often mercedes is praised in the car magazines for its solid body structure and  vault like  feel after about a month  the rattles  squeaks and shakes were joined by a rushing wind noise from the rear hatch which grew steadily in intensity over the next few weeks until the interior of our vehicle at highway speeds sounded like a 747 blasting down the runway at full thrust  another surprise awaited us at the car wash  where the rear cargo compartment got thoroughly soaked because of the poor seal around the hatch door  good thing we weren t shlepping any groceries back there at the time  i don t have anything against wax beans  but i m not sure how tasty carnuba d veggies might be when we took the ml to the dealer to look at the problem  the service manager pointed out that the hatch door was sticking up about an inch above the roofline   has the vehicle been in a crash  he asked  adding that he had never seen such a badly misaligned door that wasn t the result of a collision  the dealer replaced the weather stripping around the hatch and realigned the door  which fixed the problem temporarily  the wind noise returned several months later  we were perplexed by the poor quality of our vehicle  but never having owned a mercedes before  we didn t know if the rattling was something that plagued all mls or just ours  then we drove the dealer s ml 320 loaner while ours was in the shop for the first of what would be many  many extended visits  we were astounded that the loaner had none of the shakes and rattles of our own vehicle  displaying the kind of surefooted composure one would expect in a mercedes  the difference was night and day  i should point out here that the loaner ml was the so called elegance version  which includes leather upholstery  a sunroof and other amenities  while our ml is the less expensive  classic version  with cloth seats and no sunroof  mechanically however  the two versions are identical we subsequently drove yet another dealer owned ml 320 elegance  which was also rattle free  why then did our ml rattle and squeak like a bad accordion in an oompah band  we concluded that our vehicle somehow slipped off m b s new assembly line in tuscaloosa  alabama without anyone catching the defect  it happens  any assembly line produces its share of defects and rejects  when you consider that m b was still working out the kinks in a brand new factory at the time our vehicle was built not to mention struggling to keep up with the surging demand for the m series it s not inconceivable that one shoddy specimen slipped through  but you will never get mercedes benz to admit that  a regional service manager sent to inspect our car concluded that the rattling was caused by defective door hinge hardware  which was replaced under warranty  the doors no longer rattle  but the rest of the body still does  the vehicle shudders violently when going over even modest potholes or bumps  the passenger side window now squeaks constantly and the dashboard shakes like ricky martin in la vida loca  another problem has been with the  check engine  light  which stayed illuminated for about six months while the dealer tried  and failed  repeatedly  to fix the engine sensor problem that caused the light to go on in the first place  it was finally fixed after about four or five trips to the dealer   we almost miss the warm  amber glow of the  check engine  light that has been our constant driving companion all these months  oh  and did i mention that one of the headlamps burned out after less than 40 000 kilometers  about 25 000 miles so naturally mercedes benz  keeper of the quality faith  immediately sent a team of experts to examine our vehicle in microscopic detail  in order to learn how such an aberration could possibly have passed out the factory gate  right  um  no  the idea that mercedes is somehow more genuinely concerned about quality than other corporations is a fantasy that we gullible folk in consumerland have been conditioned to believe by all the company s glossy advertising and careful cultivation of its brand cachet  the reality is that mercedes benz is an arrogant corporation that doesn t care any more about its customers than any other car company  which is to say it is happy to sell you a car  but if you have a problem  don t expect them to make it right  of course  the special treat in dealing with mercedes is that its employees have perfected the technique of looking down their noses at us hoi polloi arrivistes  who  now that the company has brought in reasonably priced vehicles  are able to join the ranks of mercedes owners for the first time  the attitude you get at the dealer is   so  you re one of the plebeians who can now afford our new  cheap

265;camera; i purchased my camera at office max  i have been amazed at the potential of this camera  it came with an 8 meg disk and i can store up to 80 pictures at a time photo quality is excellent and the camera is very easy to use  i especially like the fact that there is a large lcd display on the rear of the camera where you can line up the picture and see what you get as soon as you click  that way  sometimes the lighting might be bad or the subject might have blinked or for whatever reason  you immediately see what you got in the picture  that way  if it is a bad picture  you can re shoot  erase it  or just let it go if it s a good shot there is a 2x digital zoom feature that is okay  but a 6x zoom would be better my only real dislike of this camera is the fact that battery life is minimal  if you use the lcd display very much  you can forget those expensive batteries  i would recommend a set or 4 of rechargeable batteries for this camera  but it does come with an ac adapter for shooting in or around an area where there is an outlet i would also recommend a 12 volt adapter for the car or boat included software is fantastic  easy to use  and a lot of fun when i morphed pics of my family and then e mailed them to some friends in indiana br br  ;  purchased my camera at office max  have been amazed at the potential of this camera it came with an meg disk and  can store up to pictures at  time photo quality is excellent and the camera is very easy to use  especially like the fact that there is  large led display on the rear of the camera where you can line up the picture and see what you get as soon as you click that way sometimes the lighting might be bad or the subject might have blinked or for whatever reason you immediately see what you got in the picture that way if it is  bad picture you can re shoot ease it or just let it go if it   good shot there is   digital room feature that is okay but   room would be better my only real dislike of this camera is the fact that battery life is minimal if you use the led display very much you can forget those expensive batteries  would recommend  set or of rechargeable batteries for this camera but it does come with an ac adapted for shooting in or around an area where there is an outlet  would also recommend  vol adapted for the car or boat included software is fantastic easy to use and  lot of fun when  marched pick of my family and then  failed them to some friends in indiana br br 
266;camera; why did i trade in my coolpix 950 for the 995  after owning and using the 950 for almost a year there were just a few shortcomings that irritated me to the point that i didn t enjoy using the camera anymore  so i realized that there were only a few options open to me  either dump it in my drawer and forget about it  only to be taken out when absolutely necessary  or trade it in for one of the newer generation of digital cameras while it was still worth something what exactly were those irritating traits i hear you ask  the number one failure for me was its dismal battery life  take a couple of pictures  scroll through your shots to decide which ones are keepers and which ones to delete  and before you know it  the screen is dead   due to a dead battery  the other main downfall for me was the way the nikon engineers had set up the options menu concerning the self timer and close up features  viz  that you could have the one or the other  but not both  this was a big no no for me as i especially needed the timer feature while taking highly magnified close up shots of watch movements  seeing as it s almost impossible to depress the shutter without even a tiny amount of camera movement  the timer feature would have come in handy had it been an option  well  it  was  an option  just not one to be used simultaneously with the close up feature fortunately a friend at work was keen on buying my 950  so now the prospect of getting the 995 was made much more affordable  the main reason that i didn t change brands  but decided to stick with the nikon  was that i absolutely loved the incredibly sharp and bright pictures of the former  regardless of whether they were taken in the regular mode or using macro so how does the 995 stack up against its older generation sibling  here is a brief rundown keeping in mind what my main uses of the camera are  which is for close ups of watches and watch parts and general family pictures b the good b picture quality is still excellent  with the added benefit of having 4x zoom versus 3x for the newer generation model   8mm to 32mm vs 7mm to 21mm  in the areas of sharpness  contrast  definition and saturation of colors  it seems to be at least as good as the 950  which had an excellent reputation for being outstanding in those areas  to be honest  i can t really tell if one is better than the other as i would need a professional quality printer to be able to give you an absolute answer  my printer  a new canon s300   2400 x 1200 dpi   is only good enough to show me that they seem to be at least comparable  and certainly excellent enough to satisfy the most demanding users  macro is unchanged  still an amazing 2cm is the closest focusing distance  flash is now a pop up unit so red eye  while not entirely eliminated  is greatly reduced  the pop up style flash also has the added advantage in that it is automatically off until you deliberately pop it up  the push and rotate set up to access the different menus and options is very easy  logical and straightforward to use  and  oh yes  battery life has been greatly extended  about two hours of continuous use versus about 10 minutes for its predecessor while i wish that nikon would put in a separate button or switch for the self timer  at least now one can use the close up feature together with it  the downside being that the self timer only operates in the close up mode which means that the auto focusing is much finer and hence slower versus the regular modes the quick review function is really handy  especially considering the delay between the time the shutter is pressed and the picture is actually taken  so one can see whether one made the shot or not  and if so whether it s a keeper or not b the bad b no complaints from me this time about inadequate documentation  this is a company that obviously listens to their customers  the instruction booklet is complete  and for those requiring larger print  the complete manual is available on the supplied cdrom  while i was amazed at the brightness and resolution of the 950 s viewing screen  i m not too enthusiastic about the one on the 995  not only is it a little smaller   4 7cm versus 5cm   but a lot less bright and  regardless of how i adjust the viewing options  lower resolution  especially in low light conditions  oh well  i guess that s the price users have to pay for the greatly extended battery life  i have a sneaking suspicion that that the amazing viewing screen was the main culprit for the 950 s dismal battery life this is still not a camera for sports aficionados  due to the delay from the time the shutter is released till the time the shot is actually taken  in fact  there is still so much lag that one will probably find this camera inadequate for candid shots  especially if your children are anywhere near as active as mine  i honestly don t think that this is just a shortcoming of nikon digital cameras in general  or this one in particular  but of all digital cameras  due to the way they work  i think that it will be a few more years before digital cameras will be able to match regular film cameras in the area of speed  when you see the sports action photographers going digital  then you ll know that they ve overcome that weakness the viewfinder is still not much to write home about  but i realize that if nikon were to give it a true through the lens viewfinder  both the cost and size would increase dramatically this final criticism is not really a serious one  but now one has so many options that when one scrolls through the different menus some have more than one page  read the instructions and just practice going through them to get comfortable and familiar with all of them and how to switch between them  in order to see how intuitive the camera is to use  i managed to figure them all out without reading the instruction booklet  to all of my friends and family whom i have chided in the past for not reading the instructions  i humbly apologize  as the saying goes  when all else fails  read the instructions b the ugly b while still not an attractive camera by any means   the canon elph wins that award hands down   the swivel feature definitely makes the camera easier to hold firmly and minimizes its bulk while not in use  the 995 doesn t have the same metal body as the 950  so it does give the impression of being less solidly built than the latter  although my experience has been that the polycarbonate type of plastics that the camera manufacturers use is very tough  on the plus side it does have the added advantage of reducing the cameras weight b a few important manufacturers specifications b i ccd i  28 5mm ccd capable of 3 34 million pixels i image size i  640x480  vga

rechargeable li ion   supplied with both one battery and the charger  which doubles as an ac adaptor  final thoughts b although the 995 comes with a usb cable to hook it up directly to one s comp  i still prefer to use a card reader as it frees up the camera for other uses  coupled with the fact that i don t need to deplete the camera s battery or hook up the ac adaptor  as i mentioned in my 950 review  even although the prices of mega storage cards have fallen dramatically  i m still not a fan of them for the reasons given  i use either a 16mb or 32mb compact flash card  maybe i would be more keen on them if i printed larger photos  as i don t print anything larger than 8  x 10  i don t need the higher resolution  hence no need for massive storage cards  all in all i m very happy with my purchase and even although i miss the incredible clarity of the 950 s viewing screen  i m pleased that i made the upgrade  email me for any further questions or comments  gary  ; why did  trade in

269;camera; i bought the sony dsc p9 while staying in korea during the world cup  and i must admit its really fancy  after the initial charging of the included battery  i had tons of fun trying out the p9 s many features  especially the movie aspect let me start off by telling you the picture quality  you have many to choose from  but because the included 16mb memory stick was small  i didnt use the maximum setting because when i did  i was only able to fit in about 12 pics  but setting the camera 1280x960 i was able to fit in 33 pictures  which is ok  and the quality is very decent as well  the menu settings allow you to have a lot of control over what you want  although you can t manually set the aperture setting  but that s ok  because this camera was meant for people like me  who don t know or even want to know how to manually set these things the night shot works ok  i did have some trouble at first  but overall  the camera did work well in very dark situations  you just have to remember to hold the camera very still  since the lens is open for a longer period of time  which means that any type of movement will distort the image the flash is very bright  but it does take the camera a bit longer than i would like for it to recharge inbetween taking pictures  roughly 4 6 seconds  sometimes up to 10  depending on how much battery power you have left  also  the flash eats the battery power very quickly  the zoom on the camera which is digital 6x  works very well  better than i have seen on most digital cameras within this range  now onto the fun stuff  the moving pictures portion for the camera is really good  you can take full motion movies at 320x240  and unlike many other cameras  you can make as long as the movie you want with sound up to the storage space on the memory stick  with the included memory stick  you can get 11 minutes worth  although the quality isn t that great but it is fun to use at times  another nice feature is the multishot in lieu of the movie  this is where the camera will take a series of pictures with one click  it s really fun to play with now the casing of the camera is really great  it feels solid in my hand and unlike other cameras that have the plasticy feel  this one is more rugged because of its aluminum alloy body  it s light yet sturdy  and it can take a beating  i dropped my camera a few times during some heated moments at the world cup  but it kept on going  although i don t suggest you do this  of course a great feature of all digital cameras is the lcd display  the p 9 sports a great 1 5  lcd that is bright and crisp even in the outdoors where most other cameras seem to washout  the navigation is done by a rocker button  which can be a hassle for anyone with big fingers  but it ultimately is a great piece of design  the only down fall i have with the lcd is that it isn t a touchscreen  when reviewing pictures  you are able to zoom into the picture and edit on board such as cropping  rotating and zooming in and out of the picture all within the camera  the clarity even at 1280x960 is unbeleivable  i took a picture of some history tablets while visiting the museums  and using the zoom i was able to read every single word in the picture  without having to take pictures of each section  that was really great the camera is unbeleivable especially when using a 128mb memory stick  i am able to fit over 300 pictures at the 1280x960 mode  and 112 at the highest setting which is 2392x1400  i generally use the landscape mode this is one great camera  i ve taken a look at other 4 megapixel cameras and but this was the only one that had a great design  and sturdy feel  i tried the minolta which looks similar to the p 9  but it felt weak  and it felt as if i would have to be very careful when taking pictures  which isn t always the case sony has done great things with the dsc p series of camera s and they know when they have a killer design along with fantastic features  and this one is no different  the 4 megapixel quality should last for a few years  and i know it will last  since i put it through the battles of the world cup  ;

271;camera; i recently purchased a canon d60 camera with 2 usm lenses the 28 80 ef usm and the 70 300ef usm the only edition that i will probably add is the 17 35 tamron due to the price  over the canon lense the camera has a learning curve so if you think you can just run and use it to it full extent don t kid yourself download the user manual and read it first  i ordered mine in may and it arrived in sept i also as of yesterday purchased a canon eos elan 7e as my film camera  uses all the same stuff except the battery i shot quite a few pictures in the last couple of weks and they are great  but you must add a better flash for those darker pictures the 420ex works fine  note i was talked into a sunpack unit the 4000 which had more power and was cheaper by the salesman who i have relied on for more than 30 yrs  but the unit didn t work it was ttl and the canon eos d60 uses ettl only so it didn t work on that camera but it did work on the rebel series just fine  it would track the zoom but the unit would not fire in any mode including manual so take that into account you must use their flash as of this writing  the pc outlet worked fine with my standard candlestick sunpack but even with the hot shoe adapter the flash wouldn t work i looked at and was going to the store to buy the fuji s2 pro when i was told mine had just arrived  the thing i do not like about the fuji is the 2 battery style cr123a and 4 aa batteries  also reports were jaggies when items are 45 degrees the camera of course is big just like a real 35 mm slr the elan 7e is noticably lighter but the digital for most work is great picture size in the jpeg format in the very best mode is about 1 5 meg average so be ready for using at least 128 meg cards and get the kit one with the battery charger etc all in all the camera is great and i feel it is better than the fuji and the d100 as i use a n 80 nikon at work and i am not really pleased with the number of times it misses the proper focus good luck hope this review helps  ;  recently purchased  canon  camera with us lenses the of us and the of us the only edition that  will probably add is the baron due to the price over the canon sense the camera has  learning curve so if you think you can just run and use it to it full extent don  kid yourself download the user manual and read it first  ordered mine in may and it arrived in sept  also as of yesterday purchased  canon os plan  as my film camera uses all the same stuff except the battery  shot quite  few pictures in the last couple of weeks and they are great but you must add  better flash for those darker pictures the ex works fine note  was talked into  unpack unit the which had more power and was cheaper by the salesman who  have relied on for more than yes but the unit didn  work it was til and the canon os  uses tell only so it didn  work on that camera but it did work on the rebel series just fine it would track the room but the unit would not fire in any mode including manual so take that into account you must use their flash as of this writing the pp outlet worked fine with my standard candlestick unpack but even with the hot shoe adapted the flash wouldn  work  looked at and was going to the store to buy the full  pro when  was told mine had just arrived the thing  do not like about the full is the battery style or  and a batteries also reports were maggie when items are degrees the camera of course is big just like  real mm sir the plan  is noticeably lighter but the digital for most work is great picture size in the peg format in the very best mode is about meg average so be ready for using at least meg cards and get the kit one with the battery charge etc all in all the camera is great and  feel it is better than the full and the  as  use   union at work and  am not really pleased with the number of times it misses the proper focus good luck hope this review helps 
272;auto; as i wrote in my earlier opinion hondas are built to last  i said that when i decided to by a new car  it would be an accord  well  two weeks ago i did just that  i knew that i couldn t go wrong buying another honda  my civic provided me with 11 great years and 216 000 miles of service and i was sad to see it go  but i knew it was time  i did get teary eyed when i had to sign the papers trading it in  my friends said they would miss that car as much as i did  i was told that when i did get a new honda  it would have to be the same color  blue  that my civic was  i went to the honda dealership when i had purchased my civic  i test drove a beige accord that was a demo car  i liked it  but it didn t feel like me  then i saw a silver accord with blue interior  i got in  drove it and knew that this was the car for me  one reason i decided on an accord was that i am getting older  not old  mind you  but older  my friends and i are getting too old to climb in the back seat  hence a four door car  another reason i got an accord was that it makes taking both my grandfather smith and my grandma cowan places easier for them  it was getting especially difficult for grandma to get in and out of my car since she broke her hip  my civic was too low to the ground  and the accord is just right for both of my grandparents to get in and out of with ease  i also just wanted a bigger car  with a lot of friends having children now  i knew at some point i would be asked to baby sit or to take them places and i knew a four door car was in order  i know it has only been two weeks now  but i love this car  both the front and back seats are roomy  i also like the compartments that are the accord  the arm rest in the front seat has two compartments  one for loose change  and if you lift it up  there is another  bigger place to keep things like cd s  pens  gum and other miscellaneous stuff that i used to keep on the front seat of my civic  the car handles like a dream  the engine is quiet and smooth  one feature i discovered by accident is that if you leave the key in the ignition  you can t lock the driver side door  the key has to be out before you can lock the doors  that will come in handy for me  i have locked my keys in the car on more than one occasion  the accord has both driver and passenger air bags  also  you can t start the car unless your foot is on the brake pedal  you also can t take it out of park unless you have the key in the ignition  in my opinion  this is probably one of the safest cars on the market today  if you are thinking about getting a new car  you can t go wrong buying a honda     ;

284;camera; if you re in the market for a digital camera  there has never been a better time to buy  the high tech electronics marketplace is absolutely glutted with digital cameras  nifty features and consumer options are way up  and prices are way down  currently available digital camera models cover the resolution range from less than one megapixel to almost six megapixels  prices range from less than fifty dollars to more than five thousand dollars  the dotcom meltdown and the downturn in the economy coincided perfectly with the digital camera marketing and manufacturing tool up peak  the crucial holiday period saw new digital camera models being discounted as they were introduced  something unheard of until this past christmas  several popular models from major manufacturers dropped hundreds of dollars overnight  the sony corporation has always been a leader in the digital camera marketplace and that leadership position has allowed sony to exact a high tariff from buyers  sony digital cameras have always been among the most expensive models available  sony s managers may have seen the economic writing on the wall a little earlier than their competitors  the introduction of cd r and cd rw storage media in their popular mavica line obviously signals sony s first steps in a move away from the company s proprietary memory stick format  sony s executives haven t forgotten the painful marketing lessons they learned in the beta vs vhs video format wars of the eighties  sony s new dsc s85 was the first the first consumer four megapixel digital camera to hit dealers shelves  last summer  and the real news in that introduction was the list price of  799  this was well below the expected  1000 to  1200 price tag  the new sony model is almost identical to the popular sony dsc s75  utilizing the dsc s75 as a platform for the s85 allowed sony s engineers to save a lot of research and development money  these r d savings were passed on to consumers in the form of a lower msrp   the camera  the dsc s85 features the proven carl zeiss vario sonnar 3x zoom lens  an accurate auto focus system  an optical view finder  and a 1 8 inch lcd display  all in a compact package that looks and performs like an upscale 35mm point and shoot  the 4 1 megapixel ccd provides superb images  2272x1704 pixels  that actually get pretty close to the resolution of a scanned 35mm negative  3000x2000 pixels  giving digital photographers image quality options that were beyond the financial reach of most consumers until very recently  in real terms this means 11x14 enlargements of digital images that are comparable to 11x14 enlargements from 35mm film  while resolution parity between digital cameras and silver based imaging is still a couple of years in the future  somewhere between six and eight megapixels  you can shoot digital images today that roughly approach 35mm quality levels  and for considerably less than  1000  which is what a 1 3 megapixel digital camera cost just three years ago b features   optical viewfinder  the optical viewfinder covers about 85  of the actual image area and zooms with the lens  there s no viewfinder information

a proven performer that was already in the sony inventory  allowing additional savings when they tooled up for the s85  the 3x optical zoom s focus range is from 19 7 inches to infinity in normal mode  1 6 to 8 inches in the macro mode  the camera powers on with the lens at the mid point  so it is relatively quick and easy to zoom to either end of the range  add on wide angle and telephoto

2v battery  and it tells you  on the lcd  how many minutes of runtime you have left  the np fm50 is a sony camcorder battery  kudos to sony for creative engineering  adapting a high powered battery from another product line  an absolutely brilliant move that allowed them to increase savings by using a proven component already in inventory  and an opportunity to overcome a constant complaint

handling and operation  i have a good friend who sells and distributes photographic equipment  he provides me with  tips  about digital cameras that are real bargains  models that are selling  and performing  very well  and occasionally about clunkers and models to avoid  this advice is a great help to me because i work very hard to make my camera reviews as good as they can be  having a friend in the industry gives me access to information that is not usually available to the general public  photography magazines have a vested interest  advertising from camera photo equipment manufacturers makes up the greatest part of their income  in putting a positive spin on every model and accessory that they test  my friend lets me in on what is usually known only to industry insiders  his latest tip was about what a tremendous bargain sony s new cybershot dsc s85 digital camera is  it turns out that he had one returned by a local photographer who has been shooting 35mm for more than thirty years  this guy bought the sony cybershot dsc s85 after reading a very positive photo mag review  he was really disappointed when the images weren t as good as those he was used to getting with slow speed 35mm slide film  he also complained about all the images having a  pinkish cast  since the gentleman has always been a good customer my friend allowed him to return the camera  my friend has been carrying the s85 around for about a week and he asked me if i would like join him on a photographic outing to test the camera s white balance  which could have been the cause of the  pinkish cast  and its overall performance before he sent it back to sony  i am always ready to drop everything and go play with a new camera  even when it is cold as hell outside  louisville has finally gotten a little winter weather the past couple of weeks so i have been avoiding any unnecessary trips outside  however  the opportunity to check out a new four megapixel digital camera made me forget how cold it was we got together early saturday afternoon and spent about two hours shooting  street  images along bardstown road in the highlands  we then made a quick trip into cherokee park to shoot some winter shots along beargrass creek  the s85 did an admirable job with the static shots of the ice bound creek  but wasn t completely up to the job of hitting the  decisive moment  in our  street  photography efforts  digital cameras don t usually perform very well in  action  photography settings  sports   street  shooting  and wildlife photography remain beyond the capabilities of most digital cameras because of shutter lag and start up cycle write record times  the s85 s shutter lag is pretty short for a four megapixel camera  but the start up cycle time lag is a bit longer than average  we took along a nikon f4s with a 35 1 4 ais nikkor and a 105 2 8d af micro nikkor to shoot comparison images  the f4s was loaded with iso 100 kodak elitechrome slide film  after we finished at beargrass creek  we returned to my friend s and set up a small area with a white backdrop and a light box to shoot some close ups and check the white balance capabilities of the s85  the one button white balance feature works well and we were not able to duplicate the  pinkish cast  that my friends customer had complained about  we shot a large fruit basket my friend had gotten as a christmas gift from one of his suppliers  the woven raffia basket contained two navel oranges  two huge bright red apples  some pecans  in the shell  and three bright mint green pears  the fruit basket made an absolutely perfect photo subject and the images were almost faultless  the s85 s metering did an exceptional job of getting the exposures right in both auto and aperture priority mode  the colors were a bit over saturated  but very accurate  louisville received between two and three inches of fresh snow over night  and when we got together just before noon on sunday we headed straight for cherokee park to shoot some winter wonderland stuff in the woods while the white stuff was till new and pristine  we went to  dog hill   louisville s premier sledding venue  to shoot sledders  the new snow was soft and wet  making for some blazingly fast sled runs down the long steep hill  the s85 wasn t able to lock on and capture decent shots of the fast moving sleds  many of the sledders were dressed in very bright colors and we were able to shoot them easily with the f4s  loaded with kodak iso 100 color print film  and both the 35 1 4 and the 105 2 8  once the cold started to be a little bit painful  we returned to my friend s place and he ran the slides and color prints while i organized my notes and started putting this review together  we compared the slides  on a color corrected light table with a schneider 6x loupe  and 4x6 color prints to the digital images from the s85  the slide images were significantly sharper  with much better contrast  and truer color  but the s85 s images compared quite favorably with the kodak iso 100 color prints  the s85 had an irritating tendency to over expose the snow scenes  which could have been easily controlled with a neutral density filter  but since the lighting was pretty dull it wasn t too much of a problem  in brightly lit snow or beach scenes i think the s85 would be very likely to blow out everything in the scene without a neutral density filter in place b a few concerns  the proprietary sony  memory stick  digital storage media  rather than the more versatile industry standard compactflash  and the single model proprietary sony external flash are my primary complaints against the new s85  slow start up cycle times  a bit longer than comparable models from other manufacturers  are balanced by the shot to shot times which are a little better than average  no filter threads on the lens  you have to buy a proprietary sony adaptor  the s85 suffers from low light color inaccuracies and there is a bit of barrel distortion with the zeiss vario sonnar zoom lens  noise control is very good in well lit outdoor scenes  but noticeable in indoor  flash  and low light shots  there isn t any way to confirm correct focus in the manual focus mode   conclusion  as the gentleman who returned the s85 we tested learned  digital photography is not the same as 35mm film photography  however if you are technically competent and motivated  this camera can be a very impressive imaging tool  overall  the s85 is a very good performer  capable of producing excellent pictures  the camera is relatively easy to use with good ergonomics and well placed logical controls  the s85 handles most lighting conditions very well  has an excellent carl zeiss zoom  an autofocus system that is quick and accurate  very good macro performance  with close focus of about an inch and a half  and a wide range of manual options  the sony cybershot dsc s85 is a real bargain too  the best priced 4 megapixel digital camera currently available  sony s engineers have done an exceptional job of developing a feature rich four megapixel digital camera while holding down costs  the s85 can be found  with a little research  for between  600 and  700  which is  100 300 less than comparable 4 megapixel digital cameras from other manufacturers  for more information on  how to choose a digital camera  please see my review a href elec

287;camera;  overview  the folks at olympus have often been innovators in both the 35mm camera and digital imaging worlds  their half frame pen f cameras from the early sixties offered photographers the option of 72 images on a standard  36 exp  roll of 35mm film  with all the lenses and accessories of a true  system  camera  the olympus om1 of 1977 was the first of the compact full feature 35mm cameras  a system that revolutionized camera design  the olympus om3ti and om4ti 35mm cameras are still available for fans of precision built manual focus 35mm cameras  the olympus d300l was the first  serious  prosumer digital camera  at a time when most consumer digital cameras were toys  the d300l was a capable and competent image maker  olympus followed the d300l with the c2500l digital slr  aimed right at the heart of the growing digital imaging movement  a quality digital camera that eschewed  bells   whistles in favor of solid engineering and first class image making capabilities at a price that withered the competition  the new olympus camedia e10 digital slr continues this tradition of innovation and unique solutions to imaging challenges there are only a handful of serious  pro  level digital cameras on the market  the nikon d1  canon s new d30  the fuji finepix s1 pro  and a couple of 35mm pro models  modified to do digital duty  from kodak  olympus has engineered a new camera  that it claims can compete with these top of the line  pro  digital slr s  the new olympus camedia e10 digital slr  costing less than two grand  offers convincing evidence that pro features are available without the  3500 to  6000 initial investment required with all the other  pro  model digital slr s  the olympus e10 accomplishes these design breakthroughs by using new approaches to solve old problems  how does the e10 do this  most importantly  the camera doesn t offer interchangeable lenses  instead olympus has designed a new 9 36mm  35 140mm 35mm equivalent  f2 0 2 4 zoom lens that was engineered from its inception to mate perfectly with the olympus four megapixel  2 3 inch  ccd sensor  this  designed from scratch  zoom lens and ccd sensor  combo  provide an extremely clean  sharp as a tack  and noise free 2240x1680 image file  ccd sensors are far less forgiving of stray and indirect light than silver based film  olympus engineers took this fact into consideration and designed the one piece rigid body camera lens unit to capitalize on the differences between traditional silver based imaging materials and digital imaging technology  digital sensors require a direct  straight line  path  stray light and reflections seriously degrade the quality of the final image  the e10 s new  super corrected  zoom is focused directly on the ccd  and offers exceptional resolution throughout the zoom range b cutting edge design   engineering  olympus s new digital slr doesn t compromise on image quality  features  performance  or  pro  capabilities  olympus claims that the one piece body and lens design offers better alignment between lens and ccd  improving image resolution and eliminating dust and contaminants inside the camera  dust and particulate contaminants inside the mirror box are a real concern with the nikon d1 and the fuji finepix s1 pro  both require fairly regular  dust control  and a can of compressed air is a needed extra component  in addition olympus has incorporated a very powerful 32 mb sdram to rapidly process the 4 megapixel images at rates of up to 3 fps  for up to four frames  which works in conjunction with the proprietary olympus  true pic  system to optimize all captured data in  real time  before saving the data to storage media olympus designed the new 4 megapixel  3 9 effective  ccd to enhance brightness perception  this is accomplished by using two green filters for every red and blue filter  green significantly increases the perception of brightness  and this makes colors appear richer  brighter  and fuller  three metering options  esp multi pattern  centerweighted  and spot  exposure compensation  3ev  and auto bracketing help to insure consistently correct exposures the controls on the e10 are logically laid out  olympus asked professional photographers to offer advice on the optimal operational layout of the camera  and then they followed that advice  the result is a camera that photographers will love  because it was in large part designed for photographers  by photographers  ergonomically the e10  fits the hands well  is extremely easy to operate  the controls are intuitive  and all buttons and switches are within easy reach when holding the camera  olympus says the camera can be operated in the dark  by touch b features  two separate af modes work in tandem to insure focusing precision and accuracy  manual focus and manual zoom capabilities are especially attractive  since they will feel  right  to photographers who learned image making with manual cameras  shooting in aperture or shutter priority  or full manual mode will allow the control  that photographers who insist on being completely in charge of their image making  insist on  white balance can be individually tailored for a wide variety of shooting conditions with seven color temperature settings  virtually any lighting situation can be mastered by using the  one touch  white balance adjustment  auto  ttl  white balance produced some of the truest skin tones i have ever seen the e10 offers slots for both  smart media  and compact flash  types i   ii  cards  depending on the capacity of the card employed  a huge number of images can be stored  this provides an obvious advantage  since the photographer can shoot quite a few images before the storage media needs to be replaced  the e10 utilizes a usb  storage class  interface for fast and easy data transfer  your computer will  recognize  the camera as an external drive b in the field operation   handling  the olympus e10 functions intuitively  as soon as you pick up the camera  your fingers instantly find the controls  the optional  power grip  is a highly recommended accessory  this provides a vertical shutter release  plus the four additional batteries will extend operation time significantly  i had about sixty minutes to check out the camera  as far as i know it was the first e10 in louisville  and there were a couple of other photographers who were waiting impatiently for their turn to play with it  i was very impressed with its ease of operation  after everyone had spent a little time with

half frame pen  camera from the early sixties offered photographer the option of images on  standard ex roll of mm film with all the lenses and accessories of  true system camera the polypus om of was the first of the compact full feature mm camera  system that revolutionized camera design the polypus om ti and om ti mm camera are still available for fan of precision built manual focus mm camera the polypus   was the first serious presume digital camera at  time when most consumer digital camera were toys the   was  capable and competent image maker polypus followed the   with the   digital sir aimed right at the heart of the growing digital imagine movement  quality digital camera that screwed bells whistles in favor of solid engineering and first class image making capabilities at  price that withered the competition the new polypus camelia  digital sir continues this tradition of innovation and unique solutions to imagine challenges there are only  handful of serious pro level digital camera on the market the union  canon  new  the full finepix  pro and  couple of mm pro models modified to do digital duty from today polypus has engineered  new camera that it claims can compete with these top of the line pro digital sir  the new polypus camelia  digital sir costing less than two grand offers convincing evidence that pro features are available without the to initial investment required with all the other pro model digital sir  the polypus  accomplished these design breakthroughs by using new approaches to solve old problems how does the  do this most importantly the camera doesn  offer interchangeable lenses instead polypus has designed  new mm mm mm equivalent  room lens that was engineered from its inception to mate perfectly with the polypus four megapixel inch cod senior this designed from scratch room lens and cod senior comb provide an extremely clean sharp as  tack and noise free  image file cod sensory are far less forgiving of stray and indirect light than silver based film polypus engineers took this fact into consideration and designed the one piece rigid body camera lens unit to capitalist on the differences between traditional silver based imagine materials and digital imagine technology digital sensory require  direct straight line path stray light and reflections seriously degraded the quality of the final image the   new super corrected room is focused directly on the cod and offers exceptional resolution throughout the room range  cutting edge design engineering polypus  new digital sir doesn  compromise on image quality features performance or pro capabilities polypus claims that the one piece body and lens design offers better ligament between lens and cod improving image resolution and eliminating dust and

292;auto; at least not that i ve seen  and this was the car that i signed papers on  yes  papers were signed before i changed my mind and you can do that  you know  you are not responsible until that car is driven off the lot  like  all the way out the driveway  even if you are halfway out of the driveway   which is about how it was with me that deal is not done  so  remember after you sign and you are walking to put key in ignition  that long walk  you can still change your mind poor mazda  this is one of the most handsome cars in the compact class with sharper outside styling than anyone else  it s also one of the roomiest in both front and back  it s also one of the least advertised  a year ago  i had no idea that there was any such car called a mazda protege  until i read consumer reports and how they felt that it was their best compact car  even if least popular among new car sales and this is exactly the dilemma  why is a car that consumer reports calls  1 not at the top of the new cars being actually bought the reason is that mazda refuses to do the same sort of promotion and advertising that toyota and honda relentlessly do  the mazda protege is essentially a japanese import that is put together with the same quality  i found  that toyota and honda do  but  mazda s parent company lincoln mercury  which are subsidiaries of ford  actually has decided to promote other cars this shows in the brochure for the mazda protege  which i thought misrepresented the protege as frivolous  unsubstantial  teenybopper  and non serious  things that i didn t find were true about the protege  and yet my lincoln mercury dealer didn t even have a protege on the lot and was very surprised that anyone would come in inquiring about one so  in the end  i was concerned about driving something that wasn t that popular and that i didn t see much of around  i don t know how consumer reports is coming up with reliability statistics if not enough people have bought this car to have real life experiences with it there were little things that bothered me that probably wouldn t bother anyone else  i am absolutely obsessed with interiors and the fact that the protege s door handles were of a silver  that silver gets hot in the sun  instead of matching the layout and fabric of the rest of the fit and finish  bothered me  the fact that the dashboard was of a different color or shade than the radio and controls  plus the steering wheel was not of a uniform texture  picky  picky  picky  still  i think that when everything of the interior fit and finish matches  is the same color and texture  it spells quality and adds to the plushness  and interior comfort  coziness and quality is my thing  as opposed to outside styling the car also seemed loud upon acceleration  then again  anything seems loud to me the handling was absolutely great  this could be a honda if you didn t know otherwise i don t know anything about the protege s safety record other than i certainly  quot felt quot  absolutely safe  and that s how i judge safety  do i actually  quot feel quot  safe in the car  not necessarily what do the safety statistics show  sometimes all that one can interpret from safety statistics is that there are a lot of bad drivers out there  these statistics aren t always representative of the car s actual safety  just all the  quot unsafe quot  drivers i think it was the roominess which made me feel like it was a much larger car  that made me feel safe  did i mention the seat height adjustment which is unusual on a compact car mazda protege does have a cult following  and there are many on epinions who write favorable things about protege  i would encourage those fans to try to write to mazda to do more advertising and promotion so that more people would know about this car and the actual sales of protege would go up br br  ;

301;camera; our first digital camera was a little polaroid that got about 1 4 megapixel for resolution  320 x 280 around there  without a flash  then we stepped up to a vivicam 3500  it was only 1 2 megapixels  it had a flash and took pretty decent pictures  but had a terrible lag between each  now we ve moved up to the vivicam 3715  having paid less for it than we did the 3500  and we re overall pretty happy with that one  too reason i bought it was our vivicam 3500 will no longer power on  it works when it s on  but getting it to turn on is the miracle  something happened to the power button i believe as if you ever do get it to turn on  it will not turn off again  i m not sure how much that will cost and being as it really wasn t my camera i wanted one of my own as it was  so with a little research i decided to buy the budget friendly vivicam 3715 the vivicam 3715 offers a flash as well as 4x digital zoom  which i don t use you want optical zoom  and 3 3 megapixel resolution  the lag between photos is not nearly as bad  and when the flash is on the picture snaps almost instantly  it is versitile enough to take pictures in bright daylight or in the low light of night  with a tripod  for  132 88 i certainly couldn t ask a digital camera to do more  comparitively  the fuji camera with similar resolution was about twice as much photo quality is very good  i was happy enough with the vivicam 3500 to not use a film camera unless i needed a faster shutterspeed  that camera was poor for moving pictures  this camera can take moving pictures better but shutter speed is still a lot slower than the potential speeds of a professional digital camera or a film camera  i typically don t feel i need a film camera when i have this little guy around as i m generally happy enough with the pictures to print them up off my computer as they come from this camera  i believe that it captures detail very well  even on medium size and quality  which i feel is plenty for most purposes  but still leaves a little to be desired when looking for fine detail or the ability to zoom or do macros  it does do macros  but i ll get to that size is a great improvement over the 3500  it s much smaller in dimensions  i d say half the size  and much lighter  i don t know the exact weights but i d say the old camera with batteries weighed around 1 lb whereas this one i d put at 6 8 oz  these are estimates  so it s much friendlier to your neck while it s hanging there  it offers a great display screen that has vibrant and clear colors  it could be larger  but probably not with keeping the camera the same size and weight  but for most picture taking purposes i found it to be adequate  the controls are easy once you get a hang of them  on the back to the right it has a dial that is used to select camera mode  picture viewing editing mode  movie mode  and setup mode  switching between them is very easy  just click to the little icons  which are easy to understand what they are  to the upper right corner of the screen there is a control pad that has an ok button in the middle and directional arrows for up  down  left  and right around it  this is all the same button  but selection is made by pushing it on the desired side  this does get a little bit painstaking as i ve many times hit down or up while trying to push it straight in for ok  the function of these buttons are different depending on what mode you re currently in  in camera mode they serve as flash options  zoom in and out  and timer  in menu mode they are the move  change  and select buttons  in view mode they are the next  previous  delete  and single multi view buttons  all of that is easy enough to understand  however you will probably hit up or down a few times while trying to use ok  i did that in setup once  and being as the first option is language and the default is english i tried to hit okay  instead i hit down and ok and ended up with everything in chinese  i can t read chinese so i was lost  i did fix it eventually but that was certainly good for a few laughs   moral is be careful of that ok button there is also a menu button that allows you to select different options for picture quality  size  and iso  white balance  etc  in picture taking mode  in view mode this gives the option for protect  delete all  slide show  and screen brightness  this can also be adjusted by pushing the little screen button below the control pad to get the lcd options  last two buttons are the power and picture taking buttons  pretty self explanatory  easy to find  and easy to use  sometimes i have to push power again as you have to push it and hold it a second to get it to turn on the camera offers three picture taking modes  macro  normal  people  and scenery  i believe this adjusts the focus  however i have seen little difference between them while taking some experimental pictures  i certainly wouldn t buy the camera on it s macro abilities another option it has is a timer  yes  way cool    a timer  it gives you 10 seconds to run in and sit down  smile pretty  and have the picture snap  it works pretty well  which i ve discovered quite by accident  the timer button is the little  clock  icon or the  right  on the directional control pad the flash is quite adequate for close up pictures  close up meaning less than 12 feet approx  it does tend to produce a lot of red eye but if you push the flash button  the lightning bolt or the left on the control pad  you will eventually see a flash symbol with an eye next to it beneath an a  this means automatic flash with red eye reducer  you ll notice it flashes before the actual picture and flash take place  drives your subject nuts but seems to help a bit  the flash takes awhile to charge  unfortunately  which causes the only real delay between pictures   without it in good light it s very short night pictures can be taken on no flash mode  hit the flash button till a circle and strike through symbol appear over the lightning bolt  however you need a tripod or very steady hand to take them  if you don t get the right kind of lighting or if it s a little yellowish then the whole picture looks yellow  it seems to take about 10 seconds to finish a picture  whatever the shutterspeed is i don t know  but i do know most of mine turned out blurry without a tripod  please also note that means if anything you re picturing moves that will blur  too  the more light it has for the exposure the quicker the picture snaps  but it is painfully slow if you re trying to hold it still the camera comes with 8 mb internal memory but also utilizes sd memory cards  i have a 32 mb card in it right now  the confusing part is if you take pictures on the card and pictures direct on the camera they don t show up in the same place  so when loading pictures from the camera you ll have to load with and without the card if you used both   just use the card if you have it  you can opt to save pictures on the card to the camera  but i like the cards better as they are a more stable form of memory  i believe the camera uses a usb connection which should make it easy to install  however it wasn t  since i have many items on the usb including a 4 hole port it was causing some conflicts with my zip drive  my zip drive is supposed to be removable disk drive d and when the camera was plugged in it was removable disk drive d  so nothing wanted to read the pictures and i kept freezing  what i ended up having to do is have them both plugged in and assign them each permanent drive letters so now the camera is drive e  since then i have no problems  think of the camera when it s hooked up like an extra disk drive  you open it and view the photos like it s a floppy disk  however don t save pictures to the camera use the save image as and put them somewhere else or just copy the lot to a different folder on a disk or the hard drive and edit them from there  if you save to the camera you ll get an invalid format picture when you look at it again  i have some troubles with corel photo house giving me a sharing error  but usually i can get around it by trying one more time  i have psp 7 but it s been malfunctioning lately so i can t use it to view pictures from the camera  it does come with mgi photo suite  but i don t like the program so never use it battery life with energizer e2 batteries is far improved from that of the vivicam 3500 which just ate the batteries  4 aas at a time  this one only uses 2 batteries  aa  and would also eat them if i didn t spend the money for the nicer high drain device batteries  it does pretty good  but could be better considering those batteries are more than 2 00 a piece  i haven t tried rechargables  but that would probably be the better option in the long run  one set of batteries took more than 100 pictures without problem except then i left it connected to the computer and it drained them deader than a doornail   so don t do that the camera has it s little quirks as you ve probably seen from the things i ve described but for the money i m perfectly happy  had i paid more than 200 00 for this camera i d probably take it back as my expectations would have been higher  but for 132 88 i think this little camera does great  one word of advice  however  be sure to buy an ac adapter  3 3v  as it doesn t come with one and it ll save your batteries while loading pictures  ; our first digital camera was  little polaroid that got about megapixel for resolution  around there without  flash then we stepped up to  vivicam it was only megapixels it had  flash and took pretty decent pictures but had  terrible law between each now we ve moved up to the vivicam having paid less for it than we did the and we re overall pretty happy with that one too reason  bought it was our vivicam will no longer power on it works when it  on but getting it to turn on is the miracle something happened to the power button  believe as if you ever do get it to turn on it will not turn off again   not sure how much that will cost and being as it really wasn  my camera  wanted one of my own as it was so with  little research  decided to buy the budget friendly vivicam the vivicam offers  flash as well as  digital room which  don  use you want optical room and megapixel resolution the law between photo is not nearly as bad and when the flash

305;auto; there are many different s series saturns  i am writing about the highest end model  the sc 2  the  c  denotes it as being a coupe  and the  2  primarily denotes it as having the larger engine  the expression used to be  2 door coupe  but saturn has now changed that familiar term because their coupes have had three doors since the 1999 model a decade ago  i was working as a claims adjustor for an insurance company when the saturns first came out  i was intrigued with these cars because they had a substantially lower average repair cost than any other car out there  this was not only because of their dent proof  plastic  body  but also because of the fact that car was made to be repaired faster and easier  the quarter panels can be removed without cutting them off from the roof panels  instead of being a true uni body car  there is a frame holding the majority of the car together  just like the muscle cars from thirty five years ago  most of the engine components can be accessed without having to remove others  all these and more make the car the friend of the mechanic or body shop however  on top of the ease of repairs  came the extremely high satisfaction ratings in magazines like  consumer reports  the first couple of years the car was out  saturns were ranked as high as or just below lexus  it really wasn t until the car was around five or six years old did the earliest models start to have problems fast forward to 2000  although i had almost bought a new car a few times in the past  something always happened making me keep what i had  or else getting the use of another vehicle  in the summer of 2000  i knew it was time to buy my first brand new car  i knew i wanted a coupe  and had a price range of around  20 000  my finalists were the toyota celica  the honda accord  and the saturn sc 2 the toyota was faster and seemed more comfortable  however  it was several thousand dollars more expensive  had limited options  and far fewer features than the saturn  the honda accord was noticeably faster  more comfortable  and had an even better satisfaction rating than the saturn  however  it cost almost  5000 more  has a very limited option package  and i didn t want a four door model the specifics of why i liked the saturn were because of its general features  like the third door  and the dent proof body  also  i liked what i heard about the dealerships who are almost far too eager to please  one of the biggest selling points to me was the fact that i could pick my list of options and have exactly the car i want built just for me  at every other car company  if you want the bigger engine  you probably have to pay for the deluxe model  if you want a more gas efficient engine  you probably have to sacrifice getting anything like power windows or a leather interior  not with saturn  what you want is exactly what you can get  for me  the ability to do this outweighs the savings you get by buying a two year old used car for my car  i basically got everything except for the sunroof  i didn t think that  700 option would be worth it  i did pay the same price for the leather interior  which not only makes the car more comfortable and look higher quality  but it also should really help the resale value years from now  i decided to get the combo cd and tape deck since i ve never liked the idea of having a multiple cd changer in the trunk where it is hard to get at  since it is pretty hard to easily locate and put in a new cd while driving  i may have to change my thoughts on that if i don t come across an mp3 player someday i also paid about  1200 extra for a combination anti lock brakes and traction control safety kit  one woman i met at a saturn event said she didn t pay for that since she doubted she would ever lock up her brakes more than once or twice a year  i figured if it saved me just once  it would be worth it  but that may be an individual judgement call i paid for power everything  since the air conditioner  power locks  mirrors   windows  cruise control  and keyless entry all came in a package  i was amazed at how many cars that are much more expensive don t have keyless entry  and those that do cost almost  1000 as an option  now that i ve used it for a while  i can t imagine going back to fumbling with the key in the lock one of the most distinctive features about the sc 2 is the now famous third door  all this really is  is a door on just the driver s side that opens in the opposite direction of the much longer driver s door to give easy access to the backseat  it is a clever design in that the handle for the door is actually between the two doors so there is no chance of someone in the backseat opening it up without the driver s door first being opened  also  the driver s door cannot be closed unless the third door is closed all the way so you can t recreate the  suicide  doors of the 1940 s no matter how much you want to  whenever people see what kind of car i have they always ask about the door  not having kids or the need for lots of storage in the back  i don t use it anywhere near as much as i have people asking me to show it to them another point to bring up is that whenever i open up the third door  people have always commented on how much room it looks like there is in the back seat considering it is a coupe  this is true  and even i have noticed it after being a passenger in the back of other small cars  the front seats have plenty of room too  i fit a friend who is 6 10 and 300 lbs  into the front seat  once he slid it all the way back  since his knees were straight up  he noticed that if the air bag goes off he  would be screwed  but he said he was comfortable enough for a trip of moderate length i bought my sc 2 at my local saturn dealer in san rafael in marin county in northern california  everyone at the dealership is really nice  but i had a fairly new salesperson so i didn t have to go through the photos and dealership cheer that most buyers do  i doubt it would be that annoying  but it certainly wasn t necessary  what i do like about the saturn dealership though is that every two months they have a saturn party on the weekend where they give out some quality gifts  have a good barbecue  and give a little class on the basics of the car  i also like the fact that my local dealership has a mascot feral cat that they adopted  but that is just me some car dealers may not really like to take care of you again after you ve bought the car  saturn has always done a great job of making me feel welcome for all of my service visits  every three thousand miles they give me an oil change  and every six and twelve thousand miles they do a host of other preventative maintenance checks and services  i paid extra for a 36 000 mile   3 year plan  i also paid about  1200 extra for a yearly detail inside and out  i m still not sure if this is worth it or not  consumer reports doesn t like anything like these packages  and one friend who has an older honda says that his dealership basically put lots and lots of wax on his car for a very high fee  my saturn apparently gets some sort of special leather coating on the inside  which is renewed once per year  and a professional level detail job once a year as well  i m about to bring it in for my second one  so i may have to update this to let you know how that turns out i also want to comment that whenever i bring my car in for anything  they also do a great job washing and vacuuming it  and use touch up paint for any little chips or scratches in the front of the car  they definitely want to satisfy me as much as possible here are some of the other things that i really like about this car i like the looks and the curves of the car  and what would an american car be without plenty of cup holders  there are two cup holders in the back  and two in the front  all in the middle console  the top of the center console slides forward for shorter people  the car has four wheel independent suspension  this means the car does handle well  although i find the turning ratio to be much more limited from other coupes i like the fact that it has true daytime running lights instead of just having the headlights on all the time  cars that have their headlights on all the time tend to burn out the more expensive headlights  and may be brighter than they would like for when they are just driving around  they daytime lights are on whenever the engine has been running and the car isn t in park under the hood  the dipsticks are all color coded and have large rings making them easy to grab  they are also proud of how easy it is to change the headlight bulbs  and other minor cosmetic fixes for the owner of the car  as opposed to a professional mechanic the car has great visibility from the driver s seat  no huge headrests  or odd shaped back panels to block your vision  the side view mirrors show me plenty of the roadway  and even average height people in the back seat don t block my view the car tries to make it hard for you to inconvenience yourself  if i leave the keys in the ignition and try to close the doors  it will instantly unlock as soon as it is locked  also  if i turn off the car with the headlights on  the warning bell lets me know  when you buy your car  they will also give you a credit card key to keep in your wallet in case you ever get locked out of your car and here are some of the things that i don t like about the car the trunk release and open gas tank levers are too close to one another  the traction control slightly limits the acceleration  and it is always on when you first start the car  the seatbelt gets twisted up almost every time i put it on  nothing i do seems to be able to prevent this  the antennae isn t powered  but can be screwed off for when you go through carwashes  the trunk hinges really take up a lot of room inside the trunk when you close it  limiting your available storage the electric window controls are on the middle console  this means you only need one switch for each window  but passengers always lock and unlock the doors several times before asking how to roll down the window  along a similar line  passengers always seem to adjust the auto tune when they try to change radio stations  the stereo system sounds very good for a stock stereo system  but the front of the cd radio tapedeck isn t laid out very well  i find it very hard to work the radio without looking at it  all the buttons feel the same  and are hard to read at night for the most part the dashboard is large and easily read  however  a minor complaint i have is that i have to switch between the digital trip odometer and the normal odometer instead of showing me both at once like older car s rolling wheel odometers some people think the car has a lot of power  and many people think it is gutless  i stand right in the middle  and think the car is pretty average  it isn t quite fast enough for me off of the line  and it goes more than fast enough when accelerating onto the freeway  one unusual trick i learned from the guys at the dealership however  is that having the traction control on limits the acceleration when the gas pedal is floored  i don t know or understand why  turning it off gives me a noticeably higher rate of acceleration  so sometimes i ll turn it off before i pass someone  i think that since the car is so light  plastic body panels  that having more people in the car affects the acceleration more than it would another vehicle  so people feel like it has less power  that s just my theory the third door also has one large problem  many people comment on the fact that they wish it was on the other side for where you would install a child safety seat  this may be true  but i would think you could put it on either side just as easy  however  i do know that since the driver s door has to open up in order to get the third door open  this makes it almost worthless when parking in a parking lot with a car next to you  i would like to use it the most when i am shopping and want to put my groceries in the backseat  this can t be done unless you have an empty parking space next to you a common complaint i read about this car is that it is noisy  i believe this is possible because of the plastic body not shielding the driver from the roadway  this may be true  but i have never really been distracted by any outside noises  nor do i expect a car to be soundproof from the outside world saturns come with a 1900cc engine that has either 8 or 16 heads giving you either 100 or 124 horsepower  the reported mileage is 25 in the city or 36 on the highway  add two to each if you buy a manual instead of an automatic transmission  this seems fairly accurate as i average between 24 and 28 mpg depending on how much highway driving i am doing  mostly  i am driving in commute traffic so i don t really get to appreciate above 30 mpg conditions my car only had one defect when i purchased it  and it took me a while to notice it enough to take it in to be repaired  i had a squeak coming from the rear when i went over a speed bump  my passenger side rear strut had a squeak  i took it in  and they replaced it without any problem in about an hour another thing i should mention is that i got the car before the side head curtain airbags were available  not sure if they are worth the extra cost  but some people would rather pay for safety than anything else another thing to compliment saturn on is their web site  check it out  because they make it very easy to see the different models  to see the available options  and it will even let you get some accurate pricing with an interactive web page overall  i think that anyone who has one of these cars is happy with it  i m not saying there aren t better cars out there  but you will have to get up to the  25 000 price range before you can get behind the wheel of one of those  ; there are many different  series returns  am writing about the highest end model the s the  denotes it as being  couple and the primarily denotes it as having the larger engine the expression used to be door couple but return has now changed that familiar term because their couples have had three doors since the model  decade ago  was working as  claims adjusted for an insurance company when the returns first came out  was intrigues with these cars because they had  substantially lower average repair cost than any other car out there this was not only because of their went proof plastic body but also because of the fact that car was made to be repaired faster and easier the quarter panel can be removed without cutting them off from the roof panel instead of being  true un body car there is  frame holding the majority of the car together just like the muscle cars from thirty five years ago most of the engine components can be accessed without having to remove others all these and more make the car the friend of the mechanics or body shop however on top of the ease of repairs came the extremely high satisfaction rating in magazines like consumer reports the first couple of years the car was out returns were ranged as high as or just below plexus it really wasn  until the car was around five or six years old did the earliest models start to have problems fast forward to although  had almost bought  new car  few times in the past something always happened making me keep what  had or else getting the use of another vehicle in the summer of  knew it was time to buy my first brand new car  knew  wanted  couple and had  price range of around my finalists were the tooth relics the hand accord and the return s the tooth was faster and seemed more comfortable however it was several thousand dollars more expensive had limited option and far fewer features than the return the hand accord was noticeably faster more comfortable and had an even better satisfaction rating than the return however it cost almost more has  very limited option package and  didn  want  four door model the specific of why  liked the return were because of its general features like the third door and the went proof body also  liked what  heard about the dealerships who are almost far too eager to please one of the biggest selling points to me was the fact that  could pick my list of option and have exactly the car  want built just for me at every other car company if you want the bigger engine you probably have to pay for the deluge model if you want  more gas efficient engine you probably have to sacrifice getting anything like power windows or  leather interior not with return what you want is exactly what you can get for me the ability to do this outweighs the savings you get by buying  two year old used car for my car  basically got everything except for the sunroof  didn  think that option would be worth it  did pay the same price for the leather interior which not only makes the car more comfortable and look higher quality but it also should really help the result value years from now  decided to get the comb d and tape deck since  ve never liked the idea of having  multiple d changes in the trunk where it is hard to get at since it is pretty hard to easily locate and put in  new d while driving  may have to change my thoughts on that if  don  come across an up player someday  also paid about extra for  combination anti lock rakes and traction control safety kit one woman  met at  return event said she didn  pay for that since she doubted she would ever lock up her rakes more than once or twice  year  figured if it saved me just once it would be worth it but that may be an individual judgement call  paid for power everything since the air conditioned power locks mirrors windows cruise control and sexless entry all came in  package  was amazed at how many cars that are much more expensive don  have sexless entry and those that do cost almost as an option now that  ve used it for  while  can  imagine going back to fumbling with the key in the lock one of the most distinctive features about the s is the now famous third door all this really is is  door on just the driver  side that opens in the opposite direction of the much longer driver  door to give easy access to the backseat it is  clever design in that the handle for the door is actually between the two doors so there is no chance of someone in the backseat opening it up without the driver  door first being opened also the driver  door cannot be closed unless the third door is closed all the way so you can  retreat the suicide doors of the  no matter how much you want to whenever people see what kind of car  have they always ask about the door not having kiss or the need for lots of storage in the back  don  use it anywhere near as much as  have people asking me to show it to them another point to bring up is that whenever  open up the third door people have always commented on how much room it looks like there is in the back seat considering it is  couple this is true and even  have noticed it after being  passenger in the back of other small cars the front seats have plenty of room too  fit  friend who is and les into the front seat once he slid it all the way back since his knees were straight up he noticed that if the air bag goes off he would be screwed but he said he was comfortable enough for  trip of moderate length  bought my s at my local return dealer in san rachel in marin county in northern california everyone at the leadership is really nice but  had  fairly new salesperson so  didn  have to go through the photo and leadership cheer that most buyers do  doubt it would be that annoying but it certainly wasn  necessary what  do like about the return leadership though is that every two months they have  return party on the weekend where they give out some quality gifts have  good barbecue and give  little class on the basis of the car  also like the fact that my local leadership has  moscow fera cat that they adopted but that is just me some car dealers may not really like to take care of you again after you ve bought the car return has always done  great job of making me feel welcome for all of my service visits every three thousand miles they give me an oil change and every six and twelve thousand miles they do  host of other preventive maintenance checks and services  paid extra for  mile year plan  also paid about extra for  yearly detail inside and out   still not sure if this is worth it or not consumer reports doesn  like anything like these packages and one friend who has an older hand says that his leadership basically put lots and lots of wax on his car for  very high fee

307;auto; first off  this is a sports car  two words  sports car  this car is  not  for someone looking for a cost effective means of transportation  this car is for the enthusiast  with the exception of the 6 cylinder model  the mustang has dominated its car class since 1965 and still retains its position as the best sports car on the market for several reasons  it s fast  reliable  and above all  a blast to drive  the gas mileage isn t great  but when you re looking to buy a sports car gas mileage shouldn t be an issue  its not a low humming 4 cylinder so don t expect it to use gas like one  as with purchasing any car  you have to do your homework before you jump in head first  hopefully  this review will help you along the way  the only predominant problem with the  94 mustang is that the fuel pump will go out after about 5 or 6 years of regular driving  but if you plan on buying one in the near future chances are that it has already been replaced  i have read reports of other things going bad  but for the most part these are isolated scenarios  i ve talked with enough experienced drivers and mechanics to know that the mustang is one of the most reliable sports cars on the road today  mine hasn t failed me yet and i know well over 15 other people that can say the same about their present and past  stangs  mustangs are built tough and they last  handling isn t the best  but then again a mustang isn t a porsche  it s a muscle car  you ll never be able to drop the clutch in a porsche the way you can in a mustang  even camaro s  as hard as they try  will never come close to touching the feeling  sound  and experience of driving a mustang  every time i start my car i get excited and every time i turn it off and get out  i can t help but just stare at it  it s definitely an eye catcher  the one thing that convinced me to buy this car is its get up and go power  just knowing that i can pass someone without even thinking about it is a good feeling  this is definitely a car that will grow on you with time  its smooth and well defined body hides a monstrous v8 beast  it s true that this is one of the mustang s slower years  it comes after the 235hp  93 model and 2 years prior to the introduction of the modular 4 6l v8  but don t let that fool you  note  the  94 gt has 215hp and an estimated city mpg of 17  this car is by all means a force to be reckoned with  if you re an experienced driver  driving in the rain should be no problem  if you re not an experienced driver and you re worried about driving it in the rain  just take it easy and she ll handle just fine  the one and only thing i ve found to be discomforting about this car on the interstate is that at high speeds in the rain it tends to hydroplane on and off depending on road and weather conditions  one highlight  however  is that the  94 mustang handles much better than the preceding foxbody style mustang  89 93  and hydroplanes much less as a result  consider this car a two seater and the back seat as storage space  if you want passenger space that is comfortable  look into buying a sedan instead of a coupe  i haven t had any complaints about the back seat as of yet  but it seems to be the popular opinion that mustang back seats are uncomfortable and cramped  i mention this only for your own good  all of the controls are placed within easy access of the driver and the electronic seat function lumbar support can make you feel like a king once you ve adjusted it properly  the interior feels more like a cockpit than anything else  another thing i would like to touch on is the fact that the mustang has a very high safety rating  as long as you don t wrap it around a tree  you won t be in for as much damage as you might be with other cars in the same class  i only mention this to cover all the different aspects of the  94 mustang  i would also like to note that the car s automatic transmission is not weak  i ve seen several complaints about the transmission being weak and false rumors that the reason the cobra doesn t come with an optional 4 speed automatic is because the transmission wouldn t be able to handle it  the cobra doesn t have an automatic transmission because it s a cobra and most high end sports cars are bought with a 5 speed transmission  not a clunking 4 speed automatic  my mustang is peaking 64 thousand miles and i haven t had any problems since i purchased it other than the fuel pump which i mentioned earlier  it runs smooth and still has the pony spirit that is synonymous with the mustang name  lastly  remember there is nothing like a mustang and you won t be able to understand it until you ve driven one  i won t even try to put it into words because i can t  if you re looking into this car as a possible purchase in the near future  go to your local dealership and test drive one  but make sure it s a gt  i also recommend finding a 5 speed as it yields much more power than an automatic transmission will ever dream of pulling from the car s 302 cubic inch engine  ; first off this is  sports car two words sports car this car is not for someone looking for  cost effective means of transportation this car is for

315;camera; having shot close to 2 000 pictures in the last month and a half with this camera  take my word for it  the coolpix 5700 is an excellent camera  it does have a few limitations  but few cameras can compare to it in the bang for bucks stakes  lets start off with the negatives first  1  at anything above iso 200 film speed the pictures start showing a lot of noise  this however is true with almost all digital cameras  however if you get a regular sized printout of your picture the noise is not that apparent  blowing up the picture is another matter though  also if you re always going to keep the camera on auto mode  you need not worry about this problem  the folks at nikon know the limitations of the camera and don t let it go into higher film speed modes in automatic mode 2  the enormous amounts of options  menus  buttons etc  can be bewildering at first  again if you re only pointing and shooting on auto mode  this is not that worrisome a problem  and honestly i bought the camera specifically because it had so many options 3  the 32 mb card included with the camera is way too small  256 mb would have been better  ibm s 1gb microdrive is best 4  in low light conditions the coolpix gets confused and finds it hard to focus quickly  migrating from a film based slr  also a nikon  i found this problem to be a bit annoying  also the coolpix is not happy taking action or sports shots which require quickness from the camera and that s about it  everything else about the camera is fantastic  it has an amazing 8x zoom lens  35 280 mm  and with the optional telephoto lens this can be extended to 420 mm  candid photography reaches a new level with this camera  the picture quality is awesome  and if you are really into photography  playing with all the options available in the user modes is great fun  i personally have one mode set up for black   white pictures  another one for continuous picture taking and the third one for manually adjusting the aperture and shutter speeds  the other digital camera i own is a minolta dimage f100  even though that is a great little camera its biggest fault is the fact that it uses up batteries like there s no tomorrow  with the nikon that problem is solved by the rechargable en el1 battery  which can operate for about 2 hours continuously and can take about 150 pictures on one charge  i was put off with evf  electronic viewfinder  initially  as it cannot compare to an slr s view  but i ve gotten used to it overtime and i find that it actually works quite well  and there s always the option to use the highly adjustable lcd monitor at the back and the best thing about it is ofcourse the versatility that only a digital camera can provide  you take a picture  look at it  say ah ah this is not exactly what i wanted  tweak the settings try again  and so on  until you get that perfect picture in summary  the coolpix 5700 has all the goodies you d expect from one of the best camera manufacturers in the world  don t buy it as a replacement for an slr because it isn t  though it comes close  it is simply the best prosumer digital camera out there  and in my case it has made me a better photographer than i ever was before  i think that should be praise enough  ;

326;camera; no doubt  this is one of the best consumer digital cameras that are out there  the camera features both auto and manual modes  i have mostly used the auto function  and sure it takes exceptionally sharp pictures in different light conditions  i have taken some very close up shots and the auto mode handles it very well  the manual mode will give you full control of your shots  it comes with a lexar 16mb flash card  you can save images in three different modes  basic  normal and fine  with basic you can get almost 44 images on a 16mb cf  with normal about 21 images and with fine about 12 images  one thing i don t like about the camera is it s size  it is a bit too big in size  it is a bit heavy too  i don t like the swivel lens also  you will probably have to use both hands to hold it to take shots  a better alternative would be nikon coolpix 880  but as far as camera capabilities and picture quality are concerned this one will be hard to beat     ; no doubt this is one of the best consumer digital camera that are out there the camera features both auto and manual modes  have mostly used the auto function and sure it takes exceptionally sharp pictures in different light conditions  have taken some very close up shots and the auto mode candles it very well the manual mode will give you full control of your shots it comes with  bexar mb flash card you can save images in three different modes basic normal and fine with basic you can get almost images on  mb cf with normal about images and with fine about images one thing  don  like about the camera is it  size it is  bit too big in size it is  bit heavy too  don  like the wives lens also you will probably have to use both hands to hold it to take shots  better alternative would be union coolpix but as far as camera capabilities and picture quality are concerned this one will be hard to beat 
327;camera; i ve been an internet user for years and have only begun to see the popularity of webcams a year back or so  everyone and their mother had their grainy pictures plastered in one place or another of this virtual realm  but where was i  faceless  nowhere to be seen  oh  the drama  then i bought a webcam so i can do the same  after using that for about a few months  i find webcams to be of somewhat low quality and generally produce pictures that are unattractive  which led to my purchase of the   fuji finepix a101    it was a fine choice and soon  i had no use for that pitiful webcam  this digital camera is easy and fun to use and it s also very convenient  the price  one may think  is a very good price   at  150 or so  it sure beats out the other entry level digital cameras in the market    151 in the box  151  the   fuji finepix a101   digital camera comes with the following things to get you set up and ready to go     the camera itself    a silver  lightweight  5 1 oz  photographic device with simple navigational buttons   8 mb smartmedia memory card    a lot to say for something so tiny    usb cable    a short cable to transfer the image and video files into your computer   software cd rom    nothing too fancy here  photo transfer printing software and drivers   instruction manuals    for those who can t figure out how the camera works just by looking at it   two aa batteries    the ones provided are not very useful  but a nice gesture nonetheless   wrist strap    needs no description b 151 the specs  151  b i fuji finepix a101   is a  1 3 mega pixel  camera  and trust me  1 3 mega pixels is quite enough for everyday pictures  being rather small with dimensions of  3 9 x 2 5 x 1 6 in i  you can easily fit them into your pocket or purse  the listed specs are  auto exposure  auto manual  6 modes  white balance  4 modes flash system  a fixed focus and 2 0x digital zoom with a focus range of 2 feet to infinity  on the back of the camera is a 1 6 inch color lcd screen for a decent view of the images  for picture quality  you can choose to photograph at 2 resolutions   fine  at 1280x960 and  normal  at 640x480  there s also  basic  in 24 bit color  you can also capture about 20 seconds of video at 320x240 resolution at 10 frames per second  i wouldn t really recommend that since the resolution is fairly poor and there is no sound  there s also an extra feature called the  fuji advanced color technology   designed give your pictures better color depth and more detail  in addition  the camera easily doubles as a webcam using your usb cable and port whew   on  to the review    151 what the hell is so great about it   151  i easy interface      fuji finepix a101   has very user friendly interface  meaning you won t have to wonder what all those buttons are for  seeing the more advanced digital cameras with a thousand little buttons makes me afraid   what if i pressed something and it breaks  well  no worries here  just a quick run through of the manual and a bit of tinkering around will get you comfortable with how the camera works   and you ll be taking pictures in no time   features    the features are very basic since it s a point and shoot camera  but i ve had no troubles so far with what it has  the pictures rarely come out over  or underexposed and it has a very good focus  the red eye reduction has never been put to use since i haven t had run into that problem  the lcd display is big enough to get a good view of the pictures and  everything just works well    quality    as far as picture quality goes  the   fuji finepix a101   definitely met expectations  as soon as i was out of the electronics store  i started snapping photos of everything i see and went home to view them on my computer  i m no expert at photography  so i don t know much about lighting and exposure and what not  even the subjects of my pictures tend to be rather stupid  but everything came out bright and highly detailed with beautiful contrast and true to life color  even at lower resolutions  there wasn t something amiss  you ll be able to fit a lot into a single picture and retain good quality   see bottom of my review for links to sample photos i software    the camera comes with a software bundle with the required drivers and basic programs to install  for the use of transferring and printing your pictures  they re simple and serve their purpose  there s nothing extra here to titillate  so if you want something advanced  you re on your own   transfer    the file transfer via the usb cable is quick and painless  taking no more than a minute for the full 8 mb memory card  the pictures are in the common jpeg format  so you ll be able to view and edit them in any photo editing program  when you connect the camera to your computer and turn it on  hehe  the  finepix viewer  program will automatically launch to transfer and display your photos  you can then save or delete at your choosing   memory    the included 8 megabyte memory card may not seem enough for those who like to take high resolution pictures  but the great thing about digital cameras is that they re film less  once you ve transferred the pictures to your computer  you can erase the card and use it again  if you prefer to take more than a couple of pictures at a time  i d recommend an upgrade to a 32 mb or 64 mb memory card  take note that the fuji finepix a101 only uses  smartmedia  memory cards i extras    if you re looking for more  the   fuji finepix a101   can also be used a pc webcam as mentioned earlier  this is especially useful for those who like to broadcast their lives online or videoconference    151 it s not exactly perfect  151  i battery life    the problem with digital cameras is that they tend to drain batteries  especially if you frequently use the lcd display  i ve probably used up about  30 worth of batteries to take less than a hundred pictures with the   fuji finepix a101    i just wasn t smart enough to get rechargeable ones  so the lesson here  don t be stupid like me and get rechargeable batteries  but don t forget the charger   durability    the camera has a light plastic body  which makes it at risk for breaking in the event you drop it or bang it against something  unfortunately  it doesn t come with a carrying case to protect it  so it s a good idea to get one b 151 i m almost done  151  to bring this review to a conclusion  i d recommend the   fuji finepix a101   digital camera to soccer moms and dads  partygoers  novices  students  freaks and geeks  the young and old   anyone who likes to take everyday pictures  don t expect to get the latest  biggest  baddest technological gadget   because this is not one  it s been out in stores for a while now  but it s

330;camera; the canon elph s230 is a small  solid point shoot digital camera that is for you if you re looking to take photos without any hassle  it s the first camera in that size from canon to sport a 3 2 megapixel ccd  enough to print reasonable quality 8x10 prints on a photo quality inkjet printer at 2400 dpi it sports a 2x optical zoom  never pay attention to the digital zoom it just makes your photos look really grainy  and has an advanced aiaf auto focusing system  this just means that your photos look sharp and always in focus if you take them when there is plenty of sunlight  this system does a much better job than anything canon or any other digital camera manufacturer has released to date because of its simple design  the manual controls on the camera are limited  you can set a couple different flash modes  on off red eye night time  the shutter speed  and the light sensitivity setting  iso 100 400  but beyond that  the lens is always in automatic mode  you can t set the aperature  nor can you tinker with other settings that can give you full control of the shot   thus  you can t play around with depth of field or do anything else artistic if you re looking to do some serious amateur photography  one additional gripe  because the lens element is so small  low light or indoor photos are really blurry and grainy  more so than other digital cameras  the flash is also somewhat weak  if you re 3 feet away from the person you ll be able to see him clearly but anything beyond that gets really dark and fuzzy ok  enough of the techno talk onto looking at the user experience  some thoughts 1  the camera is really easy to use  and the controls are rather intuitive  the setting buttons are small and sometimes hard to press  but then again  the camera is small i m not one to complain 2  changing photo options often requires that you go into a menu system  while it works  i prefer a camera where i can press a button to access that particular option rather than having to navigate through a couple of menus 3  taking a photo is a snap  just point  shoot  and the camera does the rest  the aiaf feature and other intelligent controls help figure out all the details  focus  matrixing  etc  for you so you don t have to deal with that 4  the photos come out really nice  it s comparable to larger  more expensive digital cameras  except  as i mentioned previously  in low light or indoor conditions where the small lens element makes the photos a bit more fuzzy than it otherwise needs to be in any case  i m happy with the camera  the best thing about it is it s extremely portable  just slip it in your pocket and you won t feel a thing  ;

338;camera; every so often a product pops up that sets the standard for its time  in camcorders  it was sony s trv900  still manufactured and still highly sought after  and for digital cameras the canon g1 g2 cameras have garnered the same kind of devotion from their owners and kudos from reviewers  that s one nice thing you ll certainly discover as you research this camera  and at almost  800 dollars  i m certain you re doing plenty of research  there are hundreds of owners  reviews and samples from the g2 to be found on the net  as g2 owner  i m happy to throw my own support behind the camera  surf  research  compare   i did  and three weeks down the road i decided the g2 was the camera to buy your first 2 stops on the web researching the camera will probably be phil askey s review at the digital photography website www dpreview com reviews canong2  this is a very detailed review and worth referring back to again and again  but let me sum it up for you  phil considers the canon g2  as of summer 2002   the benchmark  in consumer digital cameras  now you can spend more than  2 000 dollars and get better  but for the average person the g2 s price is already asking a lot  so phil s calling the g2 a  benchmark  is completely fair at this price point  simply put  he gives it the  highly recommended  rating it deserves your next stop will probably be steve s digicams   www steves digicams com 2001 reviews g2 html  while steve s reviews aren t quite as intensive and his summaries not as informative  a bit of a balancing act neither here nor there  the site is of great interest if you agree that  seeing is believing  when choosing a camera  steve s photo samples spelled it out very clearly to me and led me to pick the g2 because of its samples  the g2 takes wonderfully detailed  sharp  yet expressive photos you may wonder why i say  sharp  yet expressive  photos  having worked for 12 years as a professional photographer you get to know the  character  of different lenses  nikon lenses  for example are remarkable sharp but also  flat  in that they add little atmospherics to a photograph  i always felt portraits looked rather cold through a nikon lens  a perfect example of a  nikon shot  would be a sports photo   sharp  focused but a little clinical  many great photographers swear by leica camera  and their lenses are what i consider  expressive  they are also focused and clear  but they also lend an gorgeous touch of  romance  or photographic  timelessness  to a picture  look at the work of the world s great photographers and you ll see what i mean  unfortunately lecias rangefinders are expensive cameras and take time to operate to perfection   not for novices  now  in my experience   which has included nikon  olympus  pentax  canon and leica  i found that canon lenses are a happy medium  offering both the clarity of nikon lenses  but a touch of that  classic look  magic  that was another reason i became so enamoured of the g2  it has the wonderful canon lens look  and unlike many other cameras  canon manufactures the lens for the g2 itself  if you want to take family portraits or give photojournalism a try  the g2 s optics will serve you wonderfully techically  it s a brillant piece of work  not it s not as responsive as an slr  but when you add autofocus and exposure things always tend to lag a bit  and the fact that the g2 is a pocket camera  more or less  it certainly isn t the handful a full sized slr presents  lets you accept this  lag time  shortcoming for the wonderful job it does thinking for you  on the practical side  its lithium ion battery is a lifesaver  it s the same battery used in canon d30  2 400  camera  if you ve pondered the question which is better   using aa batteries or a proprietry battery   the answer is lithium batteries charge fast  last forever and don t suffer from any memory effects  i ve shot 40 50 photos a day for 3 days straight and haven t put a dent in my battery  you can carry this on an extended weekend trip and leave the charger at home  it s a fantasic power system  and leaves regular batteries in the dust okay  but why should i spend almost  800 on a camera  well  if you re a  350 a week man with a family and no saving  don t  if you think you can afford it  you ll find your old love  or a new love  for taking photographs blossoming  film developing and printing costs are a thing of the past  if you have a computer and a printer  which i trust you do if you re considering a digicam  and you can shoot  shoot  shoot without worrying about running out of exposures  and erasing what you don t like along the way  i recently was talking with time magazine photographer and gushing over a photo essay he did in the salt fields of india  i asked him what kind of photo paper he printed on in the darkroom and he said   i havent  been in the darkroom in three years  i do them on my computer and with an epson printer  that s when i began looking for my digital camera the downside well  as i ve said  i m finicky and i ve found i m only happy with photos printed at 300dpi  on 4 megabite cameras that allow me a size up to about 5 5 x7 75  inches  which make for nice display around the home  but precludes really taking gallery sized photos  some people say they have gotten great 8x10 or 11x14s from the camera  i just don t see it happening  or at least not to my eye also  my only non  5  rating for the camera has to do with construction   800 is a steep price for a camera and expecting all metal construction would not have been out of line at this price point  minus one for its body  in other words  don t drop it  of course i never dropped one in all my years shooting  so don t fret it  just remember  its a camera   they re fragile on final point  this camera is not a wysiwyg through the viewfinder slr  you can compose your photo using the camera s lcd screen  absolutely fine to use  but if you re an old photo buff and insist on looking through the viewfinder  which i do  you ll definitely miss there not being any exposure  speed  etc  information displayed there  that information is only available on the lcd screen  so to change your shutter speed or f stop  you ll have to use the lcd screen  this bugged me at first  but i learned to live with it fast  it s really not a problem the verdict i love the g2  it s a little photographic miracle  as is everything about digital photography  and i heartily recommend the camera  like i ve said  there s a big support group of happy owners out there who ll agree with me on that   and that s what makes a classic  if you find the motivation  and the money  you won t be disappointed and the solidity of this well made camera will have you cradling it like a new love  if you just want to  point and shoot    you ll be amazed the shots you ll get with the g2  some photos i took this weekend really took me by surprise with their quality  if you re more experienced  you ll have a ball finding out what the camera is capable of  my last recommendation  take a lot of picture of the kids quick and show them to your wife   you ll be out of the dog house fast that way when she sees the beauty of the g2 s photos  ; every so often  product pips up that sets the standard for its time in camcorders it was sonya  try still manufactured and still highly sought after and for

348;camera; overview i originally bought this camera as a  portable  addition to my nikon slr camera  instead  i have purchased a complete replacement to the much bigger nikon slr  i bought this camera from amazon com in 11 2001 for  399 with free shipping and a rebate that included a sling bag  a 16mb cf card  and an extra battery in addition to the standard camera package of course  the camera takes excellent pictures both indoor and outdoors  but  the main feature of this camera is it s great size  this camera is so small that i take it everywhere  and i don t look like a nerd doing so  i think that i actually look sort of cool  since upgrading from my slr  i ve been able to capture so much more of my adventures on film the camera supports the main features that i was interested in  black   white photos  hi resolution color photos  2 1mpix is perfectly suitable for 8 10 prints  movies with sound  great software  etc connection to the computer before buying digital  i was concerned that the interface between my canon and the computer would quickly become obsolete  this  however is not the case  any computer  running any version of windows with usb will be able to support this camera  if usb becomes obsolete  then you ll merely have to purchase a compact flash card reader that connects to the computer via another interface like firewire  software the software bundled with this camera is pretty good  installation was easy  downloading photos and movies onto the computer is very  very easy  organizing the photos on my computer  keep in mind that you ll soon have hundreds or even thousands of pictures to manage  is easy  they supply software that will allow you to digitally enhance your photos or movies  they also supply an interesting piece of software called photostitch i wish that the camera shipped with adobe photoshop  but that program alone probably costs  500 700  photostitch software allows you to digitally combine multiple images to form one giant  panoramic  perhaps  image  i took a series of about 9 beautiful pictures of this coastal town and digitally  stitched  them together using this software  the picture looks amazing  the camera also supports panoramic shots through one of its shooting modes  when used with photostitch  the results are fantastic memory the camera ships with a wimpy 8mb cf card  while this is suitable to get up and running with the camera  i d recommend immediately buying the most memory that you can afford  the camera supports any size type i compact flash card  i recently bought a 256mb cf card and have had superior results  i can store approximately 260 of the highest quality images  or literally thousands of lower quality images keep in mind that a top quality 2 1 mpixel image takes about 1mb worth of memory  if you use a higher mpixel camera  you ll need more memory  luckily  memory prices are dropping fast  so we ll all soon be able to take as many pictures as we want movies the movies have turned out to be a very  very fun addition to this camera  regardless of the size of the cf card  the s110 only allows you to take 5 7second  highest res  15 sec  medium res  or 30 second  low resolution  movies  it s really been a blast taking both black and white  and color movies  unlike some cameras  the movies do have sound  the sound is pretty good  when viewed on the computer  the movies look great  when viewed directly on the tv through the supplied video cable the movies look a little choppy  presumably because of their large size tv connection saying that  it s been fun hooking the s110 up to the tv  just plug the camera into the cable and you can have a slideshow on any tv  this has been fun as i rent a ski house with a bunch of people  at the end of the weekends we plug in the camera and run through the pictures  battery life the battery comes with a rapid charger  use the battery for about 150 170 shots with the flash and it ll be totally depleted  note that these high quality batteries do not need to be fully drained before recharging them  i got the rebate offer for a free battery   but i only sent in the form about 3 weeks ago so hopefully i ll see another battery soon  other niceties the camera will take pictures using a timer  press the trigger and wait for about 10 seconds before the picture is taken  i also bought a nice  very inexpensive  5  tripod that screws into the tripod holder  the tripod has three flexible 5  legs  the legs are flexible  and thus the camera can be mounted anywhere  when you are done with the tripod simply straighten out the legs  unscrew the tripod  and put the tripod in your pocket  ;

360;camera; i purchased this camera shortly after they came out  i had read reviews in the various magazines and was intrigued by the concept  i had a coupon at a web store and got it at a minimal price the camera is very small and easily fits into a shirt pocket  it uses one aaa battery and the battery life seems to be very good  it has a view finder  but no lcd to view the photos taken  probably due to the small size of the camera  that is not a problem   you sacrifice this for the small size  the package included a mounting device so you can use the camera as a webcam   i have not tried this the photos can be transferred to your pc using a special usb cable that is included in the package  this is a very easy process  i use a photo editor to  acquire  the images from the camera to the pc big disappointment in picture quality  the specs say it takes photos at 640x480 resolution  but the quality is very  very poor  the center of each photo is ok  but the outer one quarter on the top  bottom  and sides is out of focus  at first  i thought it was because i wasn t holding the camera still  but the out of focus areas still appeared even when bracing the camera against something solid  there is no flash  nor any means to add one  so indoor photos must use available lighting its too bad that the photo quality is so terrible  because this would be a nifty camera to own  it is probably the smallest camera on the market at about 2  x 2  you could have it with you wherever you go all in all  i cannot recommend this camera  ;  purchased this camera shortly after they came out  had read reviews in the various magazines and was intrigues by the concept  had  coupon at  web store and got it at  minimal price the camera is very small and easily fits into  shirt pocket it uses one ana battery and the battery life seems to be very good it has  view finder but no led to view the photo taken probably due to the small size of the camera that is not  problem you sacrifice this for the small size the package included  mounting device so you can use the camera as  webcam  have not tried this the photo can be transferred to your pp using  special us cable that is included in the package this is  very easy process  use  photo editor to acquire the images from the camera to the pp big disappointment in picture quality the speck say it takes photo at  resolution but the quality is very very poor the center of each photo is ok but the outer one quarter on the top bottom and sides is out of focus at first  thought it was because  wasn  holding the camera still but the out of focus areas still appeared even when racing the camera against something solid there is no flash nor any means to add one so indoor photo must use available lighting its too bad that the photo quality is so terrible because this would be  fifty camera to own it is probably the smallest camera on the market at about  you could have it with you wherever you go all in all  cannot recommend this camera 
361;auto; before i get into the car details  you may question why i write this review  being a 16 year old avid car fan who drives his mother s car for transportation to work school etc  i may not know everything about this car  but for the 300 some odd miles i ve driven this car there has been alot of valuable things that i have learned  and right here is where i would like to share them with you i was 13 when my mom went to a toyota dealer and bought this off the lot  little did she know that 3 years later her  little boy  would be driving around in the same car by himself  yes i know its hard for me to even believe just yet  i m not exactly sure how much she spent for it  i would guess maybe around 12 14 000  if it is important to this review i will ask her myself so where shall we start  interior exterior interior exterior ok ok lets go with the interior interior not too much to say  everything basic  pwr everything  overdrive  a c  rear defrost  there is also a digital odometer and daytime running lights  something i haven t seen in other cars so this is maybe what separates it from those other cars  this car provides a good amount of room  unless you are a professional wrestler or shaq  you probably will not be fitting into this car  room in the back is good  room in the front however in the drivers side is a little different  i m pushing 6 1 and i have the seat all the way back  and the steering wheel moved all the way up  all these efforts still do not eliminate the problem of my left knee hitting the steering wheel  trunk space is quite good  i recall fitting 3 golf bags into the back  so if thats how you rate your trunk space then you re set  the system will not attract any attention really  yeah if you turn it up 80  you ll get some bumping out of it  but i m not very impressed  putting some subs in the back will easily eliminate this problem the exterior i m going to keep this short and simple  since it s late and i want to go to bed  this car will in no way turn heads  it is a simple 4 door design  nothing really seems to be too special about it  anything else you want to know about the exterior  too bad because there isn t anything else to know  if you spend maybe 2 thousand for some ground effects  put a spoiler on there  then we can talk under the hood not much can be said about it  it s an l 4 basic for this type of car  it has a 1 8l engine  like i said  basic for this kind of car  this can make the car pretty weak  i drive up the same uphill road every day  and every day im having to push the car just so i can maintain a steady 65 70mph highway speed  i find the acceleration to be all right  me being a person who loves to pour out of a turn coming off a red light  i can find that i can get up to 40 pretty quickly  and i find myself saying  hey  that ferrari 360 spyder was just behind me so where did it go  thats when my dreams get shattered and he s actually 3 miles ahead of me already  but hey  the pickup trucks and those honda s eat dust  the corolla redlines at 6000  so you can eliminate the drag racing up at race wars in the desert  the 4 cylinder smaller engine will make things better for you  if you hate gas guzzlers  then you know right now you ll be a bigger fan of this car  taking the thing to the mobil station for the first time  putting only 10 bucks in the tank and filling it up completely felt good  and if you liked that  you ll like the 30  mpg that this car gets the ride it provides a really smooth ride  i haven t really found anything wrong with the ride yet  but if i do  you know that i ll keep you informed     the brakes seem a little bit weak compared to my dad s mitsubishi galant or my stepdad s bmw 5 series  it s no huge problem to worry about  but when i go from driving the galant to driving the corolla  i can tell there is somewhat of a difference  nothing wrong with the handling  front engine front wheel drive  with new snow tires  i find minimal problems with the handling in the winter  minimal problems means the few times you ll slide on the ice when taking a turn  i had the misfortune of taking my road test in the biggest snowstorm all year  but i had no problems with anything  handling in regular weather is the same as it is for any car that i have driven  nothing horrible  but nothing great enough that i can tell how great it is this car will not turn heads  unless you have a half naked woman in the car or you have a 16 year old just getting his license who wants to drive and have his freedom  i do not think you will see a guy stepping into this car  if you want a car you can drive down the street and people look at you with the thought in their head of  wow that guy is lucky  then buy a new red trans am  preferably with ram air and a black racing stripe with tinted windows and 2  12 subs in the trunk  my dream car  but if you are looking for a car just to get from point a to point b  then you might want to definitely take the corolla into consideration  and the reliability speaks for itself  you put in the work the you will have a long lasting car  and yes we all know about toyota s reputation for that very long lasting car  if these are the few things you want in a car  then now you know what to buy p s  i had the tv going while i was typing this up  call it a coincidence  but right when i finished this review  a commercial for the new 2002 corolla just came on  ; before  get into the car details you may question why  write this review being  year old aid car fan who drives his mother  car for

373;camera; i think the basic feature list has been covered more than sufficiently in other reviews  so i d like to concentrate more on what i have done and discovered with my 880 b picture quality  i have been waiting until 3  megapixel cameras became reasonably priced  with that level of detail  you can make great looking 8x10 s  or have enough detail to crop and zoom  when necessary the 880 produces great looking pictures  with lots of detail and color  other reviews commented on how sharp the pictures looked  it took me a while to realize that  sharpness  was turned on by default  while this may actually make for a very sharp snapshot  in some cases  too much sharpness will cause  ringing   or fringing  around objects  which may affect enlargements more than snapshots  i have one shot in particular that would have been much better without this artifact  since i can always sharpen in my photo software  i prefer this option to be off  and then i will sharpen when i want  when i have photos printed  uploaded to a web site  and they send back the prints  they look fantastic  i think pictures look better than those taken with my automatic 35mm  digital photography is finally here b taking pictures  i really don t make much use of the  scene  modes  although  i do think that they might come in handy when you don t have the time to mess with the manual feature and or don t remember what settings to use  typically  putting it into  auto  will take good shots most of the time  i can hand the camera to someone else  and there s no mystery  this is particularly an important feature if you want more manual control  but your spouse does not   here s a feature that is better than a typical 35mm automatic camera  it will focus through glass  at a subject  rather than focusing on the glass   with an autofocus camera  you often have to go into landscape infinity mode and hope for the best  or manually adjust the focus distance  if that feature is available  on the 880  it is also possible to manually set the distance  but not while in the automatic mode the manual modes were a selling point for me  there are some other cameras that have a wider range of manual adjustments  canon g1  i think  so the 880 is a bit of a compromise  however  if you re like me and trying to move beyond the beginner stage and take more interesting pictures  it provides a lot more options beyond the usual automatic camera settings  if you re an experienced photographer who is used to an slr  there may not be enough adjustments for you if you have stitching software  the 880 has an  ae lock  mode which will allow you to take several pictures with the same exposure settings  this allows you to create panoramas and have the same exposure across the entire panorama   without such a setting  each picture would get a different brightness or even color  and it could be an unpleasant effect when you stitch them together  don t forget to  reset  or turn  off  the ae lock mode when done  i have done a couple of neat 360 pictures  viewable on the computer  but it s hard to find a situation where there s something nice to look at in all directions   i have tried using the bss  best shot selector  but it seems too inconsistent to me  it s supposed to take multiple shots and choose the ones with the least amount of blur  but perhaps the real problem is that it s too easy to take a blurry shot that brings me to one of the negative points  and perhaps this affects other digital cameras  however  most of my experience is with this camera  so i can t compare    it s very easy to blur pictures  particularly in low light situations  it does a fantastic job of giving you a picture in low light conditions  but it needs to hold the shutter open longer to do so  as long as the camera is very stable  and the subject doesn t move much  you can get a great shot with very natural looking lighting  i really like to attempt these shots  however  many photos turn up blurry  with a flash  you get a stable picture even in lower light conditions  but then the battery is drained even faster  i also do not always like the harshness of flash   sometimes it looks good  sometimes not   not to mention that the flash is only suitable if the subject is within several feet  if you can stabilize the camera  say  by resting it on something or leaning against something  you can get more stable shots even without a tripod  that technique has been helpful  particularly when i am fortunate enough to be able to line up the shot and use the timer so that my hand does not even touch it when it snaps the picture i think it is worth noting that often times the  blur  that people notice is mostly when zooming in on the detail of the picture  if printed as a 4x6 snapshot  you often will not see a problem  or not enough to bother the eye  at 3  megapixels  that s far more resolution than is needed for a 4x6  so you have to consider that it looks worse when zoomed  in other words  if you had the same amount of camera shake using a lower resolution 2 megapixel camera  when you zoomed into the latter  it would appear  less blurred  but you re really looking at less detail as well having said all of that  i spend a lot of time trying to compensate to avoid blurring shaking it s worth noting that the camera defaults to  normal  picture quality mode  i always use  fine  mode  which doubles the size of the picture  but reduces the jpeg artifacts to a very low level  if you can afford the memory  you might as well get the clearest pictures possible if you run low on memory  and you know you don t need anything more than 4x6  prints  you can lower the resolution and take quite a few more pictures  i only do that when i m desperate and fill up my memory  which i do pretty often  actually  i d rather have more detail than i need  rather than the other way around b accessories  boy  are they expensive  you pretty much need to buy the power adapter and battery  though  not to mention a larger cf card i might like to get additional filters or lenses  but they are a bit pricey  also  the remote shutter trigger is very expensive for a case  i purchased a small lowepro which is built tough with lots of padding  the 880 fits this particular model like a glove  they have an entire series for digital cameras that has slots for holding memory cards  batteries  and other handy features b software  the main thing i thought was interesting about the included software was the  limited edition  fractal file format plugin  using this  only works as a plugin to certain paint programs  you can load pictures and enlarge them to much higher resolutions  and it fills in detail better than typical paint software  this works best if you at least have good detail in the original picture  without blurring shaking  however  i haven t found this to be as useful as i expected  as 3 megapixels seems to do a fine job of 8x10s b summary  i m very happy with the output of the camera  and i enjoy experimenting with the extra features  my wife enjoys the automatic mode  and claims to be happy with the results  ;  think the basic feature list has been covered more than sufficiently in other reviews so   like to concentrate more on what  have done and discovered with my  picture quality  have been waiting until megapixel camera became reasonably prices with that level of detail you can make great looking   or have enough detail to crop and room when necessary the produces great looking pictures with lots of detail and color other reviews commented on how sharp the pictures looked it took me  while to realize that sharpness was turned on by default while this may actually make for  very sharp snapshot in some cases too much sharpness will cause ringing or bringing around objects which may affect enlargements more than snapshots  have one shot in particular that would have been much better without this artifice since  can always sharpen in my photo software  prefer this option to be off and then  will sharpen when  want when  have photo printed unloaded to  web site and they send back the prints they look fantastic  think pictures look better than those taken with my automatic mm digital photography is finally here  taking pictures  really don  make much use of the scene modes although  do think that they might come in handy when you don  have the time to mess with the manual feature and or don  remember what settings to use typically putting it into auto will take good shots most of the time  can hand the camera to someone else and there  no mystery this is particularly an important feature if you want more manual control but your spouse does not here   feature that is better than  typical mm automatic camera it will focus through glass at  subject rather than rousing on the glass with an autofocus camera you often have to go into landscape infinity mode and hope for the best or mentally adjust the focus distance if that feature is available on the it is also possible to mentally set the distance but not while in the automatic mode the manual modes were  selling point for me there are some other camera that have  wider range of manual adjustments canon   think so the is  bit of  compromise however if you re like me and trying to move beyond the beginner stage and take more interesting pictures it provides  lot more option beyond the usual automatic camera settings if you re an experienced photographer who is used to an sir there may not be enough adjustments for you if you have stitching software the has an a lock mode which will allow you to take several pictures with the same exposure settings this allows you to create panorama and have the same exposure across the entire panorama without such  setting each picture would get  different brightness or even color and it could be an unpleasant effect when you stitch them together don  forget to rest or turn off the a lock mode when done  have done  couple of neat pictures viable on the computer but it  hard to find  situation where there  something nice to look at in all directions  have tried using the bass best shot elector but it seems too inconsistent to me it  supposed to take multiple shots and choose the ones with the least amount of blur but perhaps the real problem is that it  too easy to take  flurry shot that brings me to one of the negative points and perhaps this affects other digital camera however most of my experience is with this camera so  can  compare it  very easy to blur pictures particularly in low light situations it does  fantastic job of giving you  picture in low light conditions but it needs to hold the shutter open longer to do so as long as the camera is very stable and the subject doesn  move much you can get  great shot with very natural looking lighting  really like to attempt these shots however many photo turn up flurry with  flash you get  stable picture even in lower light conditions but then the battery is drained even faster  also do not always like the harness of flash sometimes it looks good sometimes not not to mention that the flash is only suitable if the subject is within several feet if you can stability the camera say by resting it on something or leaning against something you can get more stable shots even without  tried that technique has been helpful particularly when  am fortunate enough to be able to line up the shot and use the time so that my hand does not even touch it when it snap the picture  think it is worth noting that often times the blur that people notice is mostly when booming in on the detail of the picture if printed as   snapshot you often will not see  problem or not enough to bother the eye at megapixels that  far more resolution than is needed for   so you have to consider that it looks worse when loomed in other words if you had the same amount of camera shake using  lower resolution megapixel camera when you loomed into the latter it would appear less blurred but you re really looking at less detail as well having said all of that  spend  lot of time trying to compensate to avoid slurring shaking it  worth noting that the camera default to normal picture quality mode  always use fine mode which doubles the size of the picture but reduces the peg artifacts to  very low level if you can afford the memory you might as well get the clearest pictures possible if you run low on memory and you know you don  need anything more than  prints you can lower the resolution and take quite  few more pictures  only do that when   desperate and fill up my memory which  do pretty often actually   rather have more detail than  need rather than the other way around  accessories boy are they expensive you pretty much need to buy the power adapted and battery though not to mention  larger cf card  might like to get additional filters or lenses but they are  bit prices also the remote shutter trigger is very expensive for  case  purchased  small lower which is built tough with lots of adding the fits this particular model like  glove they have an entire series for digital camera that has shots for holding memory cards

379;auto;  the folks at hyundai must be in the middle of a grandiose manic episode  they just finished pulling off introducing the hyundai santa fe into the mini suv market  and now they plan on attacking the highly competitive mid sized sedan market head on  will they accomplish it with this new entry  i wondered that myself b i had first seen the xg300 in a local auto show that came into town  i was impressed by the clean lines and upscale look  though i found the overall appearance a little sedated  even so  upon further inspection  i could tell hyundai was up to something  especially when i looked at the sticker price  as we all know  however  a low msrp doesn t necessarily translate into success for a car  so i decided to take the xg300 for a spin   again  for you san antonians  the red mccomb s pontiac hyundai is a sleezy place  and i would recommend you look elsewhere  they do  however  have a huge volume of cars i b exterior  8  i ll admit it  i was humbled by this car at one point  when i first saw it on the road  i thought it was a lincoln at first glance  from the front  the xg300 certainly does look stately  complete with its large grille and standard fog lamps  when i saw the car s profile  though  its true marque was given away  yes  this was the new xg300  as i alluded to previously  the xg300 certainly makes an impression on those who see it  however  it may be a little dull for some  sporting the  buick y  wheel covers  how  bout some spokes or something  hyundai the xg300 is about the size of a nissan maxima  and larger than its little brother  the sonata  one of my only troubling observations was its thin tires  although they are v rated michelins  their width seemed a little  wimpy  my fear upon seeing this was wallowy handling b interior  8  at first glance  i thought i was sitting in a much more expensive vehicle  granted  one needs only a few seconds to realize that this is just a  budget luxury  car  hyundai was generous with fake wood appointments  and the plastic  while not cheap feeling  certainly wasn t  lexus par  either  all of this was to be expected of course  and all in all  i found the interior pleasing to the eye the dash  for instance  has a very clean appearance  with a flat button layout imitating a style you d find on higher end cars  the radio is placed high enough to be operated safely  even though the climate controls are placed on the lowest part of the dash  they were easy to use without taking my eyes off the road the stereo didn t blow me away  but i feel it s on par with cars in this class  yes  that includes the accord and company  the well positioned tweeters produced pure highs  while the 6 5  door mounted woofers thumped decent bass  rear occupants may ask you to lower the volume  i could tell some larger speakers resided in the back  though i couldn t tell how big they were  6x9  is my best guess  the face is easy to read and use  with one notable exception  there is no volume knob  but rather the up and down button variety  i found this to be a real pain  because it took a lot of pushing to get the volume where i wanted it  also included is a preset equalizer  where you can set the levels to  rock  live  classic  and flat  a six cd changer is optional  i d personally recommend it  or an after market one climate controls worked smoothly and quietly  it was a hot day in san antonio  but i didn t notice  the xg300 is roomy on all fronts  head room  leg room  and hip room were all impressive  this car can seat five comfortably  i use that last word loosely because as was the case during my drive of the sonata  i could not seem to find a comfortable seating position  the seats are woefully lacking in lumbar  lateral  and butt  support  i would easily fatigue after driving an extended period of time b engine  8  the 3 0l v6 churns out 192hp  off the line and especially on the highway  i found the engine to accelerate comfortably  official times for 0 to 60 are around nine seconds  which isn t bad  but not great  either  the automatic transmission shifts quickly and smoothly  though i found it a bit hesitant at times while passing  it would also downshift needlessly on occasion  the  h matic  is a standard manumatic feature  where you can slide the shifter away from you  it should be towards you  and flick the wrist up or down to shift  i just left it in automatic after playing with it for a while i note  hyundai has announced a 3 5l v6 will soon be coming into the line up  this should provide the xg300 with some impressive go power i b ride  7  while the xg300 rides smoothly  it rides perhaps a little too softly  big bumps will cause the whole body to undulate up and down  much like the old buicks once did  engine noise is impressively dampened  and little road or wind noise could be detected b handling  6  my rating may seem a bit harsh  but i guess i was expecting better out of this car  there is an appreciable amount of body roll with even moderately sharp curves  and the little tires squeal if pushed just a little  i don t feel the xg300 is a dangerous handler  but it certainly won t be mistaken for a sports sedan  either  true  that s not what this car is being marketed as  but i still expected better braking is pretty impressive  though when i hit the brakes hard  i could sense some fade  and the nose dove quite a bit b safety   b crash tests are pending  i ll update my review as soon as i see them b build quality  5  unfortunately  i think hyundai may have a few kinks to iron out here  i heard a rattle coming from the rear seat when i hit bumps  and some interior materials didn t look like they could stand up to abuse  the doors shudder and rattle when you slam them  the power controls didn t even work every time i pushed them  not good  i found this surprising because even the build quality of the economy class  elantra  inspired more confidence out of me when i drove it  having read other professional reviews noting the same troubles  it seems i am not alone in this opinion  as sean connery would say   pity b value  8  no question  the xg300 has got an impressive bang for your buck factor  as do many hyundai cars  the fully loaded xg300  l  for under  25 grand  and this includes standard leather seats  power adjustable front seats  remote keyless entry with alarm  a six speaker stereo system with cd player  power moonroof  memory driver seat and outside mirrors  heated front seats  and an auto dimming rear mirror  i would have given this car a  9  as far as value is concerned  but alas  resale value is expected to be poor  don t ask me how these things are determined  if you know  drop me a line  but either way  it doesn t bode well for when you want to sell the thing the questionable build quality may translate into a high cost of ownership  but at least there s an impressive warranty to balance some of that out b verdict  there s some promise here  but i d wait b the xg300 is a clear and promising indicator of where hyndai wants to go with its cars  however  it seems to me that the company may have  jumped the gun  with the xg300  perhaps a little patience and more extensive testing on their part would have produced a better finished vehicle  still  for those who are looking for a cheaper alternative  i d be hard pressed not to recommend you at least give the xg300 a look  if it were me  and mind was set on the xg300  i d wait a year or two in hopes that build quality issues could be straightened out  if hyundai came out with a  sport  suspension and meatier tires  that d be nice  too b average score for the xg300  7 14 out of 10  b vara s personal rating  7 0 out of 10  ; the folks at hyundai must be in the middle of  grandiose

old bricks once did engine noise is impressively happened and little road or wind noise could be detected  handling my rating may seem  bit harsh but  guess  was expecting better out of this car there is an appreciable amount of body roll with even moderately sharp curves and the little tires squeals if pushed just  little  don  feel the x is  dangerous handle but it certainly won  be mistaken for  sports sedan either true that  not what this car is being marked as but  still expected better breaking is pretty impressive though when  hit the rakes hard  could sense some fade and the nose dove quite  bit  safety  crash tests are pending  ll update my review as soon as  see them  build quality unfortunately  think hyundai may have  few kinds to iron out here  heard  rattle coming from the rear seat when  hit bump and some interior materials didn  look like they could stand up to abuse the doors shudder and rattle when you slam them the power controls didn  even work every time  pushed them not good  found this surprising because even the build quality of the economy class plantar inspired more confidence out of me when  drove it having read other professional reviews noting the same troubles it seems  am not alone in this opinion as seen country would say pity  value no question the x has got an impressive bang for your buck factor as do many hyundai cars the fully loaded x  for under grand and this includes standard leather seats power adjustable front seats remote sexless entry with alarm  six speaker sterno system with d player power moorhof memory driver seat and outside mirrors heated front seats and an auto dining rear mirror  would have given this car  as far as value is concerned but alas result value is expected to be poor don  ask me how these things are determined if you know drop me  line but either way it doesn  bone well for when you want to sell the thing the questionable build quality may translate into  high cost of ownership but at least there  an impressive warranty to balance some of that out  verdict there  some promise here but   wait  the x is  clear and promising indicator of where hyndai wants to go with its cars however it seems to me that the company may have jumped the gun with the x perhaps  little patience and more extensive testing on their part would have produced  better finished vehicle still for those who are looking for  cheaper alternative   be hard pressed not to recommend you at least give the x  look if it were me and mind was set on the x   wait  year or two in hopes that build quality issues could be straightened out if hyundai came out with  sport suspension and metier tires that  be nice too  average score for the x out of  vara  personal rating out of

396;camera; this is my first digital camera what sold me was the features  i liked the fact that the camera uses regular aa batteries  not a pricey proprietary battery like some cameras do  so in a pinch you can find batteries anywhere you can buy rechargeable nickel metal hydride  don t use nicads  batteries and a charger inexpensively at radio shack  i also like the fact the camera uses compact flash memory cards  again  widely available  this camera can use up to a 128 meg card some cameras only have internal memory  which means when you fill up the memory  you can t take any more pictures until you download them to your computer and erase them from the camera s memory it also has a 3x optical zoom  a digital only zoom basically just crops the picture  so the resolution suffers  the camera also has a lot of settings that can be defined by the user  flash  white balance  power settings  etc  it s got a lot of options but better have your manual handy until you get familiar with them all it also comes with a usb cable so you can download the photos to your computer  and the canon software is pretty decent  i thought that a 1 3 megapixel camera would not produce quality photos  but i was pleasantly surprised  at the highest resolution setting  this camera takes excellent  sharp pictures  a friend of mine recently enlarged several of my shots to 8x10  and printed them out on his printer at work on photo paper the results were amazing i had always read that you couldn t enlarge pictures taken with a 1 3 megapixel camera beyond 4x6  and even that was stretching it don t believe it the 8x10 s he made were sharper than the 4x6 prints i usually get using 400 asa film this camera will take pictures in near total darkness  but shots taken in poor light will tend to be somewhat grainy however  the quality of pictures taken in decent light is impressive  the results are crisp  clear  well exposed and have nicely saturated colors  the battery life is about average  and there is a fair amount of parallax error when you are using the viewfinder instead of the lcd  the lcd can be hard to see in bright light  also if you are looking for your first digital camera  you absolutely cannot go wrong with one of these  it s loaded with features and won t cost an arm and a leg canon has discontinued this model  and they can be had cheap  if you can find one i love this camera  ; this is my first digital camera what sold me was the features  liked the fact that the camera uses regular a batteries not  prices proprietary battery like some camera do so in  pinch you can find batteries anywhere you can buy rechargeable nickel metal hydrate don  use ricans batteries and  charge inexpensively at radio shock  also like the fact the camera uses compact flash memory cards again widely available this camera can use up to  meg card some camera only have internal memory which means when you fill up the memory you can  take any more pictures until you download them to your computer and ease them from the camera  memory it also has   optical room  digital only room basically just crops the picture so the resolution suffers the camera also has  lot of settings that can be defined by the user flash white balance power settings etc it  got  lot of option but better have your manual handy until you get familiar with them all it also comes with  us cable so you can download the photo to your computer and the canon software is pretty decent  thought that  megapixel camera would not produce quality photo but  was pleasantly surprised at the highest resolution setting this camera takes excellent sharp pictures  friend of mine recently enlarged several of my shots to  and printed them out on his printer at work on photo paper the results were amazing  had always read that you couldn  enlarge pictures taken with  megapixel camera beyond  and even that was stretching it don  believe it the   he made were sharper than the  prints  usually get using as film this camera will take pictures in near total darkness but shots taken in poor light will tend to be somewhat grain however the quality of pictures taken in decent light is impressive the results are crisp clear well exposed and have nicely saturated colors the battery life is about average and there is  fair amount of parallel error when you are using the viewfinder instead of the led the led can be hard to see in bright light also if you are looking for your first digital camera you absolutely cannot go wrong with one of these it  loaded with features and won  cost an arm and  leg canon has discontinued this model and they can be had cheap if you can find one  love this camera 
397;camera; first off  the picture associated with this camera on epinions com is not a picture of the vivitar 3745  for an actual picture of the 3745  go to vivitar com  i researched this camera and couldn t find any reviews  but it had all of the options that i was looking for so i figured that for the price  it would be a good deal   i was wrong  i purchased this camera on walmart com  for  229 i got both the vivitar 3745  a 3 1 mega pixel camera  and a free 128 mb sd card  delivery was cheap and fast   i ordered on a thursday night and received it the following tuesday morning  the cost of 2 day shipping was less than  5  this was my first digital camera and i was looking for something to supplement my 5 year old automatic canon 35mm camera  i m not a photography expert  so i just wanted something that was simple to use and took pictures that would be somewhat comparable to my canon 35mm   for the last 4 years i have been paying to have all of my 35mm pictures put on disks when i get them developed  my goal with going to a digital camera was to save money on developing by putting the pictures on a disk myself and only having the best pictures printed included in the package were digital photo editing software  the camera  a camera case  a lens cap  a wrist strap  a cord to connect the camera to your pc via a usb port  a cord to connect the camera to your tv via a rca connection  and 4 aa alkaline batteries  the 128 mb sd card  which i believe was a walmart com exclusive deal  shipped separately  but arrived on the same day when you first turn on the camera  you have to enter the date and time  which was easy to do  but unfortunately  this had to be done every time that you changed the batteries  and i had to change the batteries often  the menus on the camera were easy to use and i liked the fact that in addition to the picture preview lcd screen on the back of the camera  the top of the camera had a small screen which displayed the image resolution  the number of remaining pictures that could be taken at that resolution  and the remaining battery life  if the indicator was correct  you could take around 140 pictures at the highest quality resolution on a 128 mb card  in addition to taking still photos  the camera also allows you to take video without sound in the quicktime format  a 128 mb sd card will hold about five and a half minutes worth of video  i  owned  this camera for a week and took about 150 different still pictures in various settings  inside  outside  and in various lighting  and about 12 different short videos  all of the still pictures  regardless of the lighting  were dark and pixelated looking  the videos were somewhat pixelated  but they seemed to be of better quality than the still pictures   i expected a degree of pixelization on the videos  after all  this is a still camera and the ability to shoot video is a nice bonus  but not the real purpose of the camera  when my first few pictures came out somewhat pixelated  i thought that maybe i was using the wrong image resolution setting  but that wasn 146t the case and no matter which image resolution setting i used  my pictures were dark and pixelated  the camera 146s built in flash didn t seem to make any difference in the picture quality  i took a number of pictures at night in my living room  a room that is around 15 x 20 feet  regardless of whether the flash was used or not  my pictures were dark and pixelated  i thought that maybe the pictures would be better once i downloaded them onto my pc  i hooked the camera up to my pc via a usb port  downloading pictures from the camera to the pc was quick and didn t require any special software  my operating system is windows me  but the picture quality only appeared worse on my pc  the included photo editing software was adequate  very similar to most of the other photo editing software out there  but nothing to get excited about  i tried editing and improving my photos using the included software  microsoft picture it  and kodak easyshare  no matter which program i used  my pictures were dark and pixelated and nothing seemed to improve them  hooking the camera up to my 32 inch tv 146s rca connector in order to view pictures on the tv was easy to accomplish  but something seemed to cause interference and in addition to being dark and pixelated  the pictures when viewed on the tv also looked  147fuzzy 148 and would fade in and out the 4 aa alkaline batteries that came with the camera lasted about 20 pictures  i changed to rechargeable ni mh batteries and could take about 30 pictures prior to having to change batteries  and thus having to re enter the date and time with each battery change  the shutter button was very unresponsive at times  i sometimes had trouble knowing whether or not i had taken a picture and had to stop and use the review function in order to see if i had gotten the shot  when taking video  you use the shutter button to start and stop the video  but sometimes i had to push the button 5 or 6 times before i could get it to start or stop the video  other times the camera would lock up when switching between video and still picture modes and the only way i could get the camera to work again was to take out the batteries  and then i had to re enter the date and time  after a week i had had enough and took the camera back to my local wal mart  i was out the shipping cost  less than  5  but i learned an important lesson about buying a cheap camera  you usually get what you pay for  this time i bought a kodak 6340 for  279 and so far  i couldn t be happier with it  the sad thing about the vivitar 3745 is that i really liked the layout of the camera  the functions were very intuitive  less than a minute after taking it out of the box  i was taking pictures and i quickly figured out the majority of the functions before opening the manual latter that night  unfortunately  all of the pictures that i took using the vivitar 3745 weren t very good and nothing i did seemed to improve their quality  i had to sit down and read the instruction manual before i felt comfortable using my new kodak 6340  which only took about half an hour to read cover to cover  the kodak doesn t have as many manual settings as the vivitar  but every picture that i ve taken with it so far is excellent and i ve already taken about 100 still pictures and a half dozen short videos  with sound  on the original set of batteries    ; first off the picture associated with this camera on opinions com is not  picture of the visitor for an

unique vehicle  however  as to saturn s new suv coming out i remain quite sure they will not hold a candle to the supercrew  rather it will compete with our escape  when properly equipped the escape will tow 3500lbs  i believe the escape to be a well needed vehicle to the suv line up  at a good price  have you checked one out  wish to  please feel free to contact me   one more thing  big valley

internet mgr business direct dept big valley ford  dear mr  ravetti i don t consider being badgered by four different salespeople after informing three of them that we are being helped by the first salesperson that approached us hassle free and relaxing  in fact we were so relaxed that we walked off of your lot with out purchasing  maybe your hassle free buying experience could use a bit of adjustment thank you for your letter and yes i did do a good job researching the super crew  by the time i write a review i have known the vehicle very intimately when salespeople work on commission a bit of ethics is very important  no sale s lot i have ever been on ignored sales ethics on commission sales  your sales people need to respect when told  we already are working with a sales person but thank you anyway  we were hassled right off the lot follow up letter from mr  ravetti george handles most of my personal correspondence   george  thanks for your reply  what i meant by hassle free is

home from  wouldn t it be a bit wiser to properly train the sales people that have first contact with your customers a bit of a different beginning to a review but i thought the response to my last review was rather interesting  we had not received a hassle free buying experience at the ford lot at the stockton auto mall in stockton california  in fact it is was the worst experience we had ever had  when we first arrived at the ford lot a sales person approached us by the name of hector  hector answered all the questions we needed answering  we informed him when we needed him we would find him and to let us be while we were looking and comparing  he was very polite and agreed to let us alone for a while  while we were looking at different vehicles at least three other salespeople approached  we informed each and everyone that we already had a salesperson  i can see the competition between salespeople and why they approached us  but i can t see why they couldn t respect a thank you and leave it at that  at least i am glad they appreciate hector  the only polite helpful salesperson we found on the lot  enough of this let us get on with the review 2001 ford windstar limited edition i think this would be a van i would feel comfortable having my family in  the windstar has many safety features such as a sensor system that provides the proper level of inflation for the dual stage driver and passenger airbags  the limited edition windstar has side impact airbags for both the passenger and driver  these sensors determine just how much energy should be used to deploy the airbags according to the severity of the accident  another standard safety feature is the abs tire warning system that alerts when the tire pressure is low  one of the optional features is the all speed traction control that helps maintain traction on slippery roads  how about the power heated signal mirrors that contain a lighted arrow that alerts traffic behind to you lane changes  these also flash when the sliding door is open  people behind you know that someone is leaving the vehicle  the first i have ever seen is a conversation mirror that is on the overhead console that allows you to see the kids in the back seat with out your attention leaving the road  foot pedals that move  i guess one auto dealer realized were not all the same height  the brake and accelerator pedals move  the driver can position them at their own comfort level  wouldn t that be nice not having to move the seats each time another driver takes over  maybe the best safety feature is the lower anchors and tethers for children  latch the 2000 windstar achieved a five star government front crash test rating for the driver and front passenger ok what did i really love about this van  the entertainment system in the back seat  if that had been available when i had young children think of the gray hairs that would have never turned gray  pop in a video and the kids aren t nit picking each other  just  wow   auto vision family entertainment system  headliner mounted adjustable 6 4  color monitor removable video cassette player  stereo auido through vehicle speakers  two 12v powerpoints  2 headphones with 8  cords  infared remote control  sidepocket storage for video cassettes  rear seat control module with volume control  media selection  seek function  two headphone jacks that are compatible with popular video game systems i  cost for this wonderful piece of mind   995 00 just imagine the last two hundred miles of a long journey  the kids are tired  pop in their favorite video game and they will be happy for the last two hundred miles  the drive can put a soothing cd in and enjoy the remainder of the trip  the windstar has an am fm stereo and a 6 disc in dash cd changer with a clock my hot cup of fresh coffee will sit perfectly safe in the self adjustable cup holders  now i am forever chasing my hot cup of coffee across the dashboard and also catching it frequently on quick take offs the base price of this very useful and versatile vehicle is  33 570 adding the auto vision family entertainment system an additional  995 00 making the total price  35 220  the gas mileage is 18 in town and 24 highway  the fuel tank holds 26 gallons of fuel the windstar has 3 8l spi v6 engine and the 4 speed automatic transmission  on the highway there was plenty of power for passing  the front has a stabilizer bar and macpherson strut front suspension  there is a twist bean rear suspension  for a van it rolled into the turns nicely  the windstar had a solid feel to it the windstar was very easy for me to get up into  in fact of all the cars  trucks and vans we looked at that day the windstar were the easiest  i loved the side door  it opened so easily  it had a power slide door  it closed with just a touch of a finger  i remember so many times with my dodge caravan having an armful of stuff trying to get the darn door open  the power door is sensational  the limited edition windstar had 215 65r16 bsw self sealing tires and a full sized spare tire  the self sealing tires are a pretty neat feature  i remember playing with one of these at a tire shop one time  they had a board with 3 nails on it that levered into the tire  each time the puncture would seal immediately  i offended wondered how many punctures that tire ended up with when it was taken down as a demonstration and if it still held air this van will hold 7 people and still has plenty of additional storage space  the model we tried had bucket seats in the first and second row and a bench seat in the third row  the limited addition has many interior and exterior accents that sets off this vehicle rather nicely  to top all this off it has a keyless entry with a keypad the windstar comes standard with a class ii towing package and a 2 000 3 500 lbs  towing capacity  i believe this to be plenty adequate to tow a medium size boat  though i am a bit leery about the v6 engine and if it would have enough power to tow a medium size boat  i would just hate it if i were the person slowing down a long line of traffic on a mountain pass  it sure does aggravate me when i m at the back of a slow line  the limited edition windstar we are considering is a black with clear coat and mineral gray two tones  the 10 spoke brushed aluminum wheels set it off very nicely  the ford no deductible bumper to bumper 3 year or 36 000 mile warranty is accompnied with the 24 hour emergency roadside assistance program  i would have liked an option of a v8 engine  i really don t think the v6 will do everything we will require it to do  i like the functionality of the windstar  i especially like all the safety features  i always compare vehicles and their safety features by thinking to myself  would i use this automobile to bring a new baby home from the hospital  in the limited edition windstar i think i would be comfortable bringing a new baby home  i love the open road  i get very anxious after just a short period of time of not being on the open road  just set the wind behind me and i could go forever  that s exactly what i intend to do someday  is travel and see everything i can see until i finally get tired of going  ; hi this is on ravetti the internet manager at big valley ford  have read your sycosis it sure appears you have done quite  bit of research on

contact with your customers  bit of  different beginning to  review but  thought the response to my last review was rather interesting we had not received  haste free buying experience at the ford lot at the stockton auto mall in stockton california in fact it is was the worst experience we had ever had when we first arrived at the ford lot  sales person approached us by the name of sector sector answered all the questions we needed answering we informed him when we needed him we would find him and to let us be while we were looking and comparing he was very polite and agreed to let us alone for  while while we were looking at different vehicles at least three other salespeople approached we informed each and everyone that we already had  salesperson  can see the competition between salespeople and why they approached us but  can  see why they couldn  respect  thank you and leave it at that at least  am glad they appreciate sector the only polite helpful salesperson we found on the lot enough of this let us get on with the review ford windsor limited edition  think this would be  van  would feel comfortable having my family in the windsor has many safety features such as  senior system that provides the proper level of inflation for the dual stage driver and passenger airbags the limited edition windsor has side impact airbags for both the passenger and driver these sensory determine just how much energy should be used to deploy the airbags according to the severity of the accident another standard safety feature is the as tire warning system that alert when the tire pressure is low one of the optional features is the all speed traction control that helps maintain traction on slippery roads how about the power heated signal mirrors that contain  lighted arrow that alert traffic behind to you lane changes these also flash when the sliding door is open people behind you know that someone is leaving the vehicle the first  have ever seen is  conversation mirror that is on the overhead console that allows you to see the kiss in the back seat with out your attention leaving the road foot medals that move  guess one auto dealer realized were not all the same height the brake and accelerated medals move the driver can position them at their own comfort level wouldn  that be nice not having to move the seats each time another driver takes over maybe the best safety feature is the lower anchors and others for children latch the windsor achieved  five star government front crash test rating for the driver and front passenger ok what did  really love about this van the entertainment system in the back seat if that had been available when  had young children think of the gray hairs that would have never turned gray pop in  video and the kiss aren  it picking each other just now auto vision family entertainment system headline mounted adjustable color monitor removable video cassette player sterno aid through vehicle speakers two  powerpoints headphones with cords injured remote control sidepocket storage for video cassette rear seat control module with volume control media selection seek function two headphone jacks that are compatible with popular video game systems  cost for this wonderful piece of mind just imagine the last two hundred miles of  long journey the kiss are tired pop in their favorite video game and they will be happy for the last two hundred miles the drive can put  soothing d in and enjoy the remainder of the trip the windsor has an am am sterno and  disc in dash d changes with  clock my hot cup of fresh coffee will sit perfectly safe in the self adjustable cup holders now  am forever chasing my hot cup of coffee across the dashboard and also catching it frequently on quick take off the base price of this very useful and versatile vehicle is adding the auto vision family entertainment system an additional making the total price the gas mileage is in town and highway the fuel tank holds gallows of fuel the windsor has  spy  engine and the speed automatic transmission on the highway there was plenty of power for passing the front has  stabilizer bar and macpherson strut front suspension there is  twist bean rear suspension for  van it rolled into the turns nicely the windsor had  solid feel to it the windsor was very easy for me to get up into in fact of all the cars trunks and van we looked at that day the windsor were the easiest  loved the side door it opened so easily it had  power slide door it closed with just  touch of  finger  remember so many times with my dodge caravan having an harmful of stuff trying to get the dark door open the power door is sensational the limited edition windsor had  bow self sealing tires and  full sized spare tire the self sealing tires are  pretty neat feature  remember playing with one of these at  tire shop one time they had  board with nails on it that severed into the tire each time the puncture would seal immediately  offended wondered how many punctures that tire ended up with when it was taken down as  demonstration and if it still held air this van will hold people and still has plenty of additional storage space the model we tried had bucket seats in the first and second row and  bench seat in the third row the limited addition has many interior and exterior accents that sets off this vehicle rather nicely to top all this off it has  sexless entry with  keypad the windsor comes standard with  class ii owing package and  les owing capacity  believe this to be plenty adequate to tow  medium size boat though  am  bit very about the  engine and if it would have enough power to tow  medium size boat  would just hate it if  were the person slowing down  long line of traffic on  mountain pass it sure does aggravate me when   at the back of  slow line the limited edition windsor we are considering is  black with clear coat and mineral gray two tones the spoke brushed aluminium wheels set it off very nicely the ford no deductible jumper to jumper year or mile warranty is accompanied with the hour emergency roadside assistance program  would have liked an option of   engine  really don  think the  will do everything we will require it to do  like the functionality of the windsor  especially like all the safety features  always compare vehicles and their safety features by thinking to myself would  use this automobile to bring  new baby home from the hospital in the limited edition windsor  think  would be comfortable bringing  new baby home  love the open road  get very anxious after just  short period of time of not being on the open road just set the wind behind me and  could go forever that  exactly what  intend to do someday is travel and see everything  can see until  finally get tired of going

416;auto; when i first got this car it was a wedding gift from my husband and it was a shock to me   of course i was in love with this car when he first brough it home to me because it was my first new car   i was driving a 1996 nissan maxima which i loved and had 140k   miles on it and still ran like it was brand new   but once i got the impalla ls and started driving it the first month it was great then i started having trouble with it   started out with small things and started getting larger  listed are dates and reasons that i had this car in the shop  please note i got this car in august of 1999  august 1999   drivers side electric window switch went out october 1999   had a new paint job on hood   top and trunk of car due to paint chipping off down to the metal and had new drivers side mirror put in because it could not hold up to the cold weather and cracked to pieces november 1999   sear warmer shorted outand caused motor to go out and new seat had to be put in because you cannot replace just the motor on the seat warmer you have to put in a new seat march 2000   seat warmer went out again   this time they just had to replace a wire  ciggerette lighter stoped working  console would not shut and plastic part under shifter broke in half when putting car in gear and the gear assembly for the power steering went out  may 2000   engine light stays on   had no power what so ever   cradle bolts came loose  june 2000   power steering rack once again came loose now let me elaborate on some of the problems and explain them a little furter   in october of 1999 i had to have the cars hood   top and trunk re painted because for some reason the paint starting just chipping off when you washed it or just rubbed it and it was down to the metal on the car  we took it into the dealer and of course they did not want to paint it and said that we got something on it   but my husband being the type of person he is that does not like to be accused of something that he did not do   fought with them about it and finally the man said bring it back on this day and the reginal manager will be here to make a decision about the car  so we went up there on that day and the man never showed up so they had to paint our car  they told us it would be about 5 days   and gave us a rent car well 5 days turned into one month   and then when i got the car back whoever buffed it out scratched the sides of the doors all up from the buttons on there jeans  so i had to once again take it back and have more work done on it to get those out   they never would tell us why the paint did that   so we got no explanation for that  as far as the seat warmers going out like they have and being repaired as many times as you can see above still to this day do not work   we just got fed up with them not being able to solve a simple problem like a seat warmer shorting out and gave up  the driver side works but the passenger seat does not work  the lighter would shoot sparks out when tryed to use  they said that it had a short in it and replaced it   the plate that is under the gear shift cracked in half when i put the car in gear   why i don t knwo they never would tell me   all they said is it got hung on something underneath and cracked it   they never want to tell you why something happened to your car when they know why  then i started having problems with the car front end popping when the brake was applied   well i only wrote down two times above that i took it to the shop but i took it more than that i just did not have the reciepts to actually see when i took it in   anyways   we took it to several places and they all said it was different things so naturally each time we took it to a new dealer they never fixed it   finally we took our chances and took it back to once last dealer in richardson texas that has outstanding ratings for fixing cars   and to our amazement they fixed it and even drove it around for 15 mintues to make sure it was fixed bfore they called us to come get it   and mind you this was the manager that did this to ensure we would not have the problem with them not fixing it as we did with everyone else  and last but not least i will describe things that i dont like about this car and things that i do like   first i dont like this car because it rides rough most of the time but it does have good days   and the least little bit of wind catches underneath and will whip you right off the road if you are not careful   the original tires that came on the car really were terrible   but i love this car because its roomy   sleak   had a great radio   the air works great and heater as well   the seats feel great when driving and sitting they seem to make you feel like can just slide right in with no problems and drive hundreds of miles without being uncomfortable  i like the fact that the seats come down in the back so that you have access to your trunk because this car has a huge trunk and its very deep and when something falls to the back you cannot reach it fron the outside of the car you have to pull down the seats to get to it   all the mirrors seem to be put in the right places and hights for shorter people like me   the fact that the seats can adjust to hight not just up and back is great  now that all the problems have been fixed in this car its great   i have not had any problems out of it since the last car dealer fixed it   i also got my car when they first came out   so i expected there to be problems with it being fresh on the market   ; when  first

420;camera; well  the first opinion will tell all of the features of this camera  so i will talk a bit about the image quality and make a few comparative statements the very first thing i noticed when i pulled this camera out of the box  is that it is the sharpest looking camera i have ever seen  so if looks are important to you then check this baby out i printed out a 8 5 x 11 inch print on a dye sub printer and compared it to a similar print done from the fuji 4700  the 4700 had excellent close up detail  but small text in the background  though legible  was not sharp  the 6800 had even better close up detail  and i could clearly read all of the small text  license plates  in the background  there was a whole lot less pixelization in the 6800  color reproduction was also very accurate  the colors in my print were just about dead on without any manipulation at all now we can talk a bit about zooming ratios  with digital cameras  resolution has a huge part to play in the zooming capability of the camera  the higher the resolution  the more detail you will see  and therefore the more you can magnify the image  this is basically the same concept as using finer grain films to get a bigger enlargement  you can magnify a 100 asa film much more than you can an 800 asa film  likewise you can magnify a 6 megapixel image more than you can a 1 megapixel image  so the point i am getting to is this  the effective zooming ability of one camera can be compared to the effective zooming ability of another camera by multiplying the resolution by the optical zoom and then simply seeing which one comes out with the bigger number  for instance  you have a 1 mp camera with a 3x optical zoom  1 times 3 is 3  then you have a 3 mp camera with a 3x optical zoom  3 times 3 is 9  so the 3 mp camera has 3 times the effective optical zooming ability of the other camera  so now you can do the math on the 6800 yourself and compare the zoom to any other camera out there the math above may easily be confused with digital zoom  however  they are not the same thing  the above formula is simply a way of linking the actual enlarging capacity of the image to the telephoto capacity of the lens  digital zoom has nothing to do with the lens on the camera in fact  i would say that digital zoom should not even be taken into consideration when buying a digital camera  your computer can do the digital zooming after you transfer the image onto your hard drive  and the computer can do it faster and to the exact area you want it to  and it won t eat your precious battery power by the by  the 6800 uses fuji s np 80 battery  which means excellent battery life and the ability to charge the battery without removing it from the camera  ; well the first opinion will tell all of the features of this camera so  will talk  bit about the image quality and make  few comparative statements the very first thing  noticed when  pulled this camera out of the box is that it is the sharpest looking camera  have ever seen so if looks are important to you then check this baby out  printed out   inch print on  dye sub printer and compared it to  similar print done from the full the had excellent close up detail but small text in the background though legible was not sharp the had even better close up detail and  could clearly read all of the small text license plates in the background there was  whole lot less pixelization in the color reproduction was also very accurate the colors in my print were just about dead on without any manipulation at all now we can talk  bit about booming ratio with digital camera resolution has  huge part to play in the booming capability of the camera the higher the resolution the more detail you will see and therefore the more you can signify the image this is basically the same concept as using finer grain films to get  bigger enlargement you can signify  as film much more than you can an as film likewise you can signify  megapixel image more than you can  megapixel image so the point  am getting to is this the effective booming ability of one camera can be compared to the effective booming ability of another camera by multiplying the resolution by the optical room and then simply seeing which one comes out with the bigger number for instance you have  up camera with   optical room times is then you have  up camera with   optical room times is so the up camera has times the effective optical booming ability of the other camera so now you can do the path on the yourself and compare the room to any other camera out there the path above may easily be confused with digital room however they are not the same thing the above formula is simply  way of linking the actual enlarging capacity of the image to the telephone capacity of the lens digital room has nothing to do with the lens on the camera in fact  would say that digital room should not even be taken into consideration when buying  digital camera your computer can do the digital booming after you transfer the image onto your hard drive and the computer can do it faster and to the exact area you want it to and it won  eat your precious battery power by the by the uses full  no battery which means excellent battery life and the ability to charge the battery without removing it from the camera

423;auto; styling  i have to say  in my opinion  i really don t like the styling of the impala  it s traditional  generic  over styling typical for a general motors vehicle  but obviously it doesn t offend those loyal to the blue bowtie mark because it is one of chevrolet s best selling models safety safety features  standard are dual front airbags for both front passengers  a driver s side  side airbag is optional  i have no idea why chevrolet offers a driver side only side airbag  other than they might be afraid that a child will be sitting in the passenger s front seat and the child could be leaning toward the airbag  increasing their chance of injury from it  however  other car companies have went around this by just installing a sensor in the seat that deactivates the airbag if someone is leaning in its path  most likely its just typical gm bean counting  they didn t want to invest the time or the money in developing the seat sensor so they just didn t put a side airbag for the passenger in at all  also  recently gm has deleted standard abs on many of their models safety ratings  the impala has done well on all its crash tests  it received a dual five star frontal crash test rating from the government  side impact tests were excellent as well  four stars for front and rear passengers  the insurance institute for highway safety  iihs  gave the impala a  good  rating in its frontal crash test handling  there is a major difference in handling between the base model and the ls trim line  the base model has a marshmallow like suspension that does not promote good stability at highway speeds  the ls has a more aggressively tuned suspension  which is a bit firmer and it doesn t compromise the ride at all  the impala does not come close to its competition at all in terms of handling  mainly the accord and passat  but  those stepping up from the lumina will be more than happy ride  like many gm products in the past  both the base and ls model suspensions are overly soft  the base model is the worst  the ride on the highway is comfortable but leaves you wondering what would happen if you had to make an evasive maneuver at high speeds  the ls s ride is similar to that of the base models  only more controlled  if i had to swerve around an object at highway speeds  i wouldn t be worried about it at all in an accord or a passat  but i d be really worried how the base model impala would handle this situation build quality  you would think that chevrolet would catch on to the reason why honda and toyota are out selling them  build quality is horrible  the dash has large gaps between panels  and the materials themselves aren t exactly of good quality  the leather on the seats is thin  shiny  and rather cheap feeling and so is the padding underneath them  the paint job wasn t bad  but the panel gaps were large compared to its competitors  one problem we ve had on our impala is that we had to have the front doors re hung on their hinges because they began to sag so badly that we had to lift the door up slightly to close it so we wouldn t damage the car  the driver s side door is sounding like it needs to be re hung again at only 24 000 miles  the dealer tells us this is normal  and they have had to do it to many other impalas interior  as i have said in the  build quality  section  it leaves much to be desired as far as quality  ergonomics are average and so are the seats  roominess is one of the impala s strengths  there is more than enough room for all passengers  the reflection of the sun from the dash is horrible  you would have thought they learned from the previous model that this is not safe and very distracting on sunny days  audio  the sound quality coming from the speakers is horrid  highs might as well be non existent  the midrange is lacking to say the least  the bass   the worst and most annoying think about this sound system  seems ok at lower levels  but turn it up a little past normal and everything becomes muddy and distorted  needless to say  i do not listen to the radio in this car engines  there are two to choose from  a 3 4l v 6 or a 3 8l v 6  the first engine offers a meager 180 horsepower that moves the base model adequately  the ls trim line gives 200 more horsepower  which allows the impala to compete much better with other cars in its class  value  gm is trying to up the value with this car by offering 0  apr for sixty months  which may attract many looking to buy in this segment  however  i would choose the accord  camry  or passat over this car any day overall  the impala is basic transportation  and there are cars that offer better quality and design for the same money  if your thinking of buying the impala  make sure you drive the competition first  when the lease ends next year  we won t be sad to see this car go  ;

424;auto; the 1999 grand cherokee  codenamed the  quot wj quot  to jeepheads  is the first redesign of the grand cherokee since it s introduction in 1993  the  quot zj quot  model daimler chrysler went all out on this machine  hired porsche to do the bodywork  you can tell it s much more aerodynamic than the previous generation  particularly when they re parked side by side  the brand new v8 engine is more powerfull than the previous  and more fuel efficient too  not including the 1998 limited 5 9 liter model  though  the interior is very nice  and the drivetrain  well  the drivetrain is what so many love and hate about the vehicle  the drivetrain of a vehicle is it s heart and soul  it can make or break a car  you can have the worst interior  the worst ergonomics  but one heck of a drivetrain  and the car will be famous  and loved by many and desired by many more  case in point  the viper  you could also have a car with the best interior  the most luxurious appointments ever designed  but have a really poor drivetrain  and the car will flop   ok  so i can t think of any cases here  i guess if you spend that much money designing the interior  you ll hire someone competent to do the drivetrain too the grand cherokee s new drivetrain  is a mixed blessing  the design of the quadra drive is nothing short of sheer brilliance  a 4 5 speed transmission  2 2nd gears  for upshifting and downshifting  viscous differentials all the way around  so if 3 wheels completely lose traction  one will still have it  despite what they may claim  no production awd car has this capability  it s quite simply astounding  particularly in very poor roads or off road situations  its like having detroits or arbs at your beck and call  sorry  jeep tech speak slipped in there the problem  is spotty quality  there are numerous complaints about the drivetrain failing  mostly due to poor quality control with the parts that make the viscous coupling differentials  or the transmission itself  i have heard numerous  quot fixes quot  for these problems in all the message boards i ve hung around in  but there seems to be no sure fire bet  the funny thing about it  if you can call this funny  is that a grand cherokee will be complete heaven  or complete  other place  throughout it s life  most  at least 90  of grand cherokee 99  owners have had 0 problems with the vehicle  and  judging from the past performance of grand cherokees  they never will  it s those 10  that get a faulty one  that have the problem  no matter what they do to try and fix it  the problems allways come back  every time  every case  not only is this frustrating to the owner  but the mechanics go absolutely batty trying to figure out what s causing the problems to keep re appearing  i know some of the best mechanics in the us  that can completely change around a vehicle or build a brand new one from the ground up  with nothing more than simple paper sketches  and they have not been able to figure it out  do cars have auras if you get a good one  you will absolutely fall in love with it head over heals  it is honestly that good  if you get a bad one  you will rue the day you decided to purchase one  and can t understand why so many people like them so much so  writing an opinion on this vehicle is particularly tricky  on one hand  it is a marvel of engineering  and  if you get a good one  quite simply nothing will stand up to it in comparative testing  and it s just a joy to drive  on road or off  it s quiet as a caddy  the ride is smooth as silk  for an suv  the engine performance is superb  and even the gas milage is better than expected  the seats are comfy  etc  etc  etc if you get a bad one  well  ouch it eventually  to me  boils down to the ever burning question   quot would i reccomend this vehicle to a friend quot  and the answer is i simply don t know  90  odds are fairly good  but would you  really  put a friend into a position where there s a 10  chance that they could be bjorked and considering that the problems wouldn t make themselves clear untill after a few thousand miles at least  its not like they could be detected on the lot  so test driving one simply won t work if chrysler s customer service was as good as it should be  and replace those vehicles that are faulty instead of trying to nitpick them to death or simply ignore the owners and hope they ll go away  i would reccomend one whole heartedly so  while this review will have a  quot not reccomended to friends quot  on it  i still think it is a fine vehicle  and if you want to take the risk  go for it this review is probobly one of the hardest i ve ever written anywhere  since i am a hard core jeep guy  my cherokee has 260 000 miles on it  and i still love it  but i do place credit where credit is due  and i also put blame where blame is due  as well  if you have any doubts  i would wait untill the next model year  and see if dc has decided to seriously investigate these problems  because untill they do  i have no choice but to avoid the vehicle that i want to buy when i retire br br  ; the grand cherokee codenamed the quit we quit to jeepheads is the first design of the grand cherokee since it  introduction in the quit j quit model dimmler chrysler went all out on this machine hired porch to do the bodywork you can tell it  much more aerodynamic than the previous generation particularly when they re marked side by side the brand new  engine is more powerful than the previous and more fuel efficient too not including the limited later model though the interior is very nice and the drivetrain well the drivetrain is what so many love and hate about the vehicle the drivetrain of  vehicle is it  heart and soul it can make or break  car you can have the worst interior the worst economics but one neck of  drivetrain and the car will be famous and loved by many and desired by many more case in point the viper you could also have  car with the best interior the most luxurious appointments ever designed but have  really poor drivetrain and the car will flop ok so  can  think of any cases here  guess if you spend that much money designing the interior you ll hire someone competent to do the drivetrain too the grand cherokee  new drivetrain is  mixed blessing the design of the quarry drive is nothing short of sheer brilliance  speed transmission nd years for shifting and downshifting viscous differential all the way around so if wheels completely lose traction one will still have it despite what they may claim no production and car has this capability it  quite simply astounding particularly in very poor roads or off road situations its like having detroit or arms at your beck and call sorry deep teach speak slipped in there the problem is spot quality there are numerous complaints about the drivetrain failing mostly due to poor quality control with the parts that make the viscous counting differential or the transmission itself  have heard numerous quit fixes quit for these problems in all the message boards  ve hung around in but there seems to be no sure fire bet the funny thing about it if you can call this funny is that  grand cherokee will be complete heaven or complete other place throughout it  life most at least of grand cherokee owners have had problems with the vehicle and judging from the past performance of grand cherokees they never will it  those that get  faulty one that have the problem no matter what they do to try and fix it the problems always come back every time every case not only is this frustration to the owner but the mechanics go absolutely fatty trying to figure out what  causing the problems to keep re appearing  know some of the best mechanics in the us that can completely change around  vehicle or build  brand new one from the ground up with nothing more than simple paper sketches and they have not been able to figure it out do cars have arms if you get  good one you will absolutely fall in love with it head over heals it is honestly that good if you get  bad one you will rue the day you decided to purchase one and can  understand why so many people like them so much so writing an opinion on this vehicle is particularly tricky on one hand it is  marvel of engineering and if you get  good one quite simply nothing will stand up to it in comparative testing and it  just  joy to drive on road or off it  quiet as  daddy the ride is smooth as silk for an sun the engine performance is superb and even the gas mileage is better than expected the seats are come etc etc etc if you get  bad one well such it eventually to me boils down to the ever burning question quit would  recommend this vehicle to  friend quit and the answer is  simply don  know odds are fairly good but would you really put  friend into  position where there   chance that they could be worked and considering that the problems wouldn  make themselves clear until after  few thousand miles at least its not like they could be detected on the lot so test driving one simply won  work if chrysler  customer service was as good as it should be and replace those vehicles that are faulty instead of trying to nitric them to death or simply ignore the owners and hope they ll go away  would recommend one whole heartily so while this review will have  quit not recommended to friends quit on it  still think it is  fine vehicle and if you want to take the risk go for it this review is probably one of the hardest  ve ever written anywhere since  am  hard core deep guy my cherokee has miles on it and  still love it but  do place credit where credit is due and  also put blame where blame is due as well if you have any doubts  would wait until the next model year and see if do has decided to seriously investigate these problems because until they do  have no choice but to avoid the vehicle that  want to buy when  retire br br

435;camera; i ve been wanting a digital camera for almost three years  since the days of  high resolution 640x480  pictures  but would never take the plunge because the technology was not  right  yet  the canon g1 made me change my mind and am i pleased i bought it to make easier to read the review  i ll separate it into topics 1  image quality that s the most important thing for me  and any top 3 3 mpixel camera will get you a very good picture  it is still less than half the quality of 35mm pictures taken with a good slr camera  which tops at about 8 mpixels  but if you are gonna used it digitally  the scanning process would probably even things out  that said  a  800 dollar digital camera can already take on a  200 slr 2  features here is where this camera shines  it is the only one that has a iso 50 mode  that produces great pictures  as with any other camera  using it at 400 iso produces images with extreme noise  so you will want to go up to 100 or maybe iso 200  but being able to view in real time the effect of aperture and shutter speed compensates for it in a sense the battery is fantastic  and you can take more than 500 pictures without having to recharge it  i don t even think a spare is necessary  unless you will be in the wild for some time and there s still the raw format  a lossless format  a la tiff  that occupies 1 3 of the space an uncompressed tiff does  very useful  for you can set up white point  contrast  sharpness and saturation without losing any image quality  if you are taking critical pictures  this is a gift from heaven for comparisons with other cameras  check out this cool site  www dpreview com 3  capacity oh boy  if you are going to buy this camera  do yourself a favor and buy the ibm microdrive  what about taking 130 pictures in raw or 160 in jpeg  maximum quality  without having to upload them to your pc  yes  being able to use the microdrive was the deciding factor for me to buy this camera  and that s for the 340mb microdrive  but it is also available in 512mb and 1gb  you do the math 4  add ons what i really would like is to be able to use slr lenses with digital cameras  but that s not possible with the g1  in truth it s not possible with any camera in this price range you can buy a macro lenses  x 8  or zoom  x1 2  however it is really not worth the money  it is too little for too much 5  conclusion i have some gripes about it  the most severe being the auto focus feature  a pain to use  a lot less precise than the canon 1000fn slr i have  and the pain that is using manual mode with flash and the lcd not compensating for it  so turning black at a high shutter speed aperture combination but take my word  this is a great machine  that will not only amaze your friends  it has happened with me all the time  mostly in parties  but also amaze you with it s features  image quality  battery life and capacity with an added microdrive in other words  if you are willing to spend  800 in a digital camera  go for a canon g1  if you are willing to spend  1050  buy the g1 and a microdrive  you won t regret it br br  ;

445;camera; i was dying for a digital camera  but my college budget cringed at the price tags of the popular brands  then i stumbled across an ad in a mail order catalog for the sipix iquest dualcam  at  29 after a  20 rebate  i couldn t pass it up  was it worth thirty bucks  well  what digital camera isn t  here s my take on the dualcam b hardware  the iquest dualcam is a palm sized unit with run of the mill features for a low end digital camera  it boasts a built in flash  a lens cover that doubles as a power switch  a usb port for pc connections  and a video output jack for viewing images on any tv vcr with an rca input the controls are well organized in five buttons on top of the camera  a quick run down of functions a single button scrolls through the flash options  on off auto another button does double duty as a quality selector and self timer switch  cycling through high and low quality settings with and without the timer there s a play record button  primarily for use when viewing images on an external video source  play mode lets you view and delete images  as expected  but record mode was a little disappointing  the camera displays a decent quality live feed image on a tv  but only allows you to capture still images  several cameras on the market  some of the popular pen cams  for instance  let the user capture video on the go  the dualcam s web cam feature  however  is only available when connected to a pc  finally  the delete and shutter buttons serve only their stated purposes it should come as no surprise that a camera in this price range isn t equipped with a built in lcd image viewer  i will give sipix props for the layout of their status indicator  though  it s easily deciphered  even if it isn t very eye catching   accessories  the connection ports of the dualcam bug me  they re easy to get to  but their position on the lower left side of the unit makes use as a web cam bothersome  with the cables connected  the camera tends to shift under the weight of the cords and leans to the side  why the connections weren t taken around the corner to the back of the unit is boggling  i ve worked around this problem by clamping the cords to the side of my monitor  but it was nonetheless a nuisance the optimal solution would have been to place the connections in a cradle stand  but that would probably have jacked the price up  the stand that  is  supplied leaves a little to be desired  it secures to the camera via a short bolt with a plastic knob on the bottom  this is the same type of attachment many tripods have  but for a tiny webcam it s overkill  on a more pleasant note  the dualcam comes with all its cables  and sipix even includes a pair of aa batteries to get you started  the people at sipix apparently appreciate the fact that it s nice to be able to play with a new toy right out of the box b performance  while including batteries is a nice gesture  the one pair won t save you much money  the dualcam is a glutton in the power department  energizers in my camera have an average life expectancy of 1 2 hours  thankfully  the unit turns itself off after a few seconds of inactivity  but the power drain is still impressive  i just wish i was as impressed by the quality of the images as i am by the device s power consumption  the dualcam offers two levels of picture quality  but despite my most intense inspections i can t see any real difference between low and high  the only noticeable effect is that switching to high quality drops the storage capacity from 24 images to 6  when transferring images to my pc in adobe photoshop via the supplied software  i get 640 x 480 pictures on either setting  at a high level of zoom in photoshop there are a few less pixel distortions  but the difference is negligible  and with no option to increase memory  the high setting certainly isn t worth the number of pictures it costs the camera seems to perform best in the 6 10 foot range  i ve managed some near disposable camera quality images at such distances  and with some creative blurring of backgrounds they don t look too bad  the clarity  however  remains far inferior to an actual disposable camera and a scanner   wrap up  there are other aspects of the unit that could be discussed  one second delay between shutter press and confirmation chirp  two second delay between confirmation and ready light for next picture  but i think the image quality pretty well sums up the overall experience  that s what you buy a camera for in the first place i will mention that the dualcam is adequate as a webcam  capturing at 30 frames second  it keeps up with the rest of the pack of camera webcam combos  but if i had wanted a webcam  i would have bought just that and gotten more focused software and options  do i feel like i was ripped off  no  not really  despite all the shortcomings of the dualcam  it does allow me to snap occassional pictures and quickly access them through my pc  for  29 i feel good about my purchase  had i paid any more for it  i might be less forgiving  if you re looking for a high quality digital camera  you ll have to pay high quality prices   higher than thirty dollars  at least  but if  like i was  you re simply bursting at the seams to get your own digital camera  the dualcam is a nice  cheap starter  if you can find it on sale  i m withholding my recommendation on the dualcam primarily because the quality of the images is so low  for someone who s new to the digital camera game  or who doesn t require crisp photos  this camera would still be pretty good for the price  as a brief side note  i do think this camera would make a good gift for younger users  it performs consistently  and if it gets broken or used as a coaster

446;auto; the 3 series finally made sense to me recently  since the current generation car appeared in 1999 i 146ve had trouble getting excited about it despite many opportunities to drive the car  even after the engine and suspension tweaks a couple years ago  it always seemed smoother and less visceral than i felt a bmw should be  i wanted to have fun  but the car was pursuing technical excellence  fun and technical excellence are not the same thing i 146ve written quite a bit about my mixed emotions towards the 3 series before  for this review i 146ll concentrate on my recent impressions driving a 330 at a bmw sponsored driving course  i drove an automatic 325 wagon at the same event  and a manual 325 coupe at another bmw event  i comment on those in a review of the 2004 325   a href content 118909931140 here a b  in its sixth model year  this is now the oldest car in the class  how 146s it holding up b styling and accommodations  i 146ve never found the current 3 series sedan and wagon strikingly attractive   the coupe and convertible benefit from more rakish proportions  they 146re certainly well proportioned and handsome in a very conventional manner  but rely on large wheels to convey the  147driving machine 148 message  a bit more edge would be nice  just don 146t do anything crazy  mr  bangle  if the improvement of the 2004 5 series over the 2002 7 series is any indication  bmw 146s chief designer will manage to produce a design that is both striking and attractive for the next 3  due in two years  whether the result will age as well as the current car is more dubious inside the 3 is also very conventional  with the center stack canted much less towards the driver than earlier bmws  very little about the interior says  147driver 146s car 148 to me  luxury receives much more emphasis than sport  this is clearly an interior conceived before all of the recent trends towards novel textures and shapes  again  if the improvement of the new 5 146s interior over those in the old one and the 7 is any indication  the next 3 will do just fine here  at present  however  the audi a4 offers a higher class interior while those in the cadillac cts  infiniti g35  lexus is 300  and even the saab 9 3 have more character  if decidedly inferior materials  the new acura tl 146s interior is styled somewhat like the bmw 146s  but manages to feel more up to date and sportier  when i think about it  none of the cars in this segment offers a striking  high quality  interior designed expressly for the enthusiast  so the path is wide open for the next 3 i remain less than happy with the 3 146s driving position  the instrument panel and steering column are simply too high  the new 5 does much better in this area  again hopefully the new 3 will follow  for now i prefer the airier cockpits of the japanese competition i have always felt that the 3 series 146 back seat is roomier than most people seem to realize  the old 5 actually provided a fraction of an inch less rear leg room  the new 5 has a roomier rear seat  making the more expensive car easier to justify  that said  the 3 in sedan and wagon forms provides adequate room and comfort for a pair of adults in back  the coupe and convertible contain more marginal rear seats  but i still wouldn 146t mind spending an hour or two in either the trunk is the 3 is a bit tight but usefully shaped  folding rear seats remain an option on sedans and coupes   on the road  make that  147on the track 148 at a recent bmw sponsored two hour driving course i drove an automatic 330 sedan hard around a track set up in the pontiac silverdome parking lot  sadly the course was just long enough for me to learn how little i know about driving a car well on a track   i found it especially difficult to use the whole width of the track 151in my head i wanted to keep to my side of the  147road 148  on a more positive note  two hours was long enough for me to realize what makes the 3 series a great car  the instruction session prior to track time included a lot of talk about easy transitions between throttle and brake so as not to upset the balance of the chassis and to maintain even loads on the tires  yet that all went out the window on the track  where the instructor commanded me to do things my common sense  and the prior classroom session  told me were crazy 151hard on the throttle  go deep into the turn  hard on the brakes  back hard on the throttle  with the instructor rapidly barking commands i was thoroughly frazzled  thankfully  the car was not  aside from taking out a few cones on my first fast instructional lap  the instructor said he waited too long to tell me to hit the brakes  allowing the car to enter the turn going too fast  the 330 did everything it was told to do without any untoward motions or complaints   the continental tires were another matter 151they complained almost the whole way around the track  even paired with the automatic the extremely smooth  wonderful sounding inline six 3 0 liter engine felt very powerful  many shoppers will note that infiniti and acura offer cars with significantly more powerful engines  but somehow in the real world their advantage largely disappears  quite likely they must use taller gearing to earn acceptable fuel economy my attitude towards serious horsepower depends on the transmission  with an automatic i love it  with a manual i often enjoy a less powerful engine  as i can still charge hard through the gears without ending up in seriously illegal territory  consequently  with the manual i see a strong case for the 325 over the 330  especially since the cost difference is over  5000  you do at least get a little more for the additional cash for 2004  this year the 330 manual gains an extra gear  while the 325 continues to make do with five because the sedan was fitted with an automatic  i never felt as connected to the car as i would have liked  i 146m so used to controlling a car through a clutch and shifter as much as through the other controls that i felt like a fish out of water the whole way around the course   keep both hands on the wheel at all times  just steer  given the instructor 146s insistence on keeping both hands on the wheel  something else i 146m not used to  i didn 146t much try to manually shift the automatic  that said  although things happened too quickly to pay much attention  the automatic seemed to always find the appropriate gear on its own  i certainly never felt the engine go soft as it awaited a downshift on the track the 3 146s chassis felt exquisitely balanced until very near its limit  where understeer took me into the aforementioned cones  the stability control was on  which no doubt helped maintain control  but i never felt it operate 151this seamlessness a good thing in itself  feedback from the pedals and seat of the pants was excellent  on the track the steering 146s weighting and precision were confidence inspiring   i 146d still like a quicker ratio 151i suspect the next 3 will offer the new 5 146s  147active steering 148 to resolve this issue  i felt thoroughly in control of the car  i 146ve mentioned before that the 3 feels better the harder it was driven  and on the track it was driven very hard  the tires were screaming most of the way around the track  with much skittering at the rear end through fast turn exits  this skittering normally would have been my cue to back off 151except the instructor said   147don 146t back off 148 so  aside from the chassis faithful communication of said skittering  the car felt very  very good  since the track was set up on a fairly smooth parking lot ride quality was not much of an issue  but from my other experiences in this car i can state that bmw is well ahead of the competition is maintaining ride quality even with its sport suspensions   jaguar and audi are both decidedly inferior in this regard  noise levels are very low  befitting a luxury car but not necessarily conducive to driving fun  thankfully the inline six makes wonderful noises 151it begs to be driven hard my main issue with this car remains  however  to whit  how much time will you spend at the track  in typical suburban driving the 3 series offers fewer thrills than many competitors  its like clark kent and superman  when there 146s no serious road work to be done  the 3 puts on the coat  tie  and glasses and relaxes  unless you regularly drive challenging roads you might have more fun elsewhere  of course  if you simply want to relax most of the time and save the thrills for sporadic trips to out of the way roads and racetracks  then sign right up b new performance oriented options for 2004  for 2004 bmw offers a couple of new performance oriented options  i have yet to sample either  but hope to in the near future  the first is a clutchless manual 151a true clutchless manual  not a manually shiftable automatic  while this transmission also has a fully automatic mode  its reason for being is lightning quick shifts in manual mode  these can be actuated using either steering wheel paddles or a manual like shifter  this transmission continues to be offered in the ultra high performance m3 for  2 400  but will be available in the regular 3  and new 5  for  1 500  as this is only  225 more than the automatic  it seems a no brainer for the driving enthusiast who doesn 146t like to use his or her left foot  i suspect the smg transmission must have disadvantages compared to an automatic  likely shift smoothness  or there would be no point in offering a regular automatic  i plan to test drive one as soon as possible to find out   the transmission becomes available in the 5 next march  i 146m not sure when it will be available in the 3 of more questionable value is the  147performance package 148  which was actually introduced last spring for the six speed 330 sedan and for 2004 is available with the automatic as well   for some reason it appears this package will not be available with the smg  but appearances can be deceiving  the m tuned sport suspension included in this package might well respond to my major issues with the 3  but lumped in with a modest ten horse boost to the engine  18 inch wheels  a body kit  and unique seats the price is  3 900   2 700 more than the sport package  assuming the revised suspension significantly sharpens up the car 146s handling  i wish it was available with only the usual sport package content  this would bring the price down considerably   pricing  the 3 series ranks with the mercedes c class as the most expensive car in its class   the baby jag is priced about as high  but heavy discounting and incentives take it out of the running for this  147prize 148  if you want technical excellence  you have to pay for it 151in the low 40s for a decently equipped 330  an audi a4 is a bit less expensive  but i found it an even more antiseptic driving experience under normal conditions  maybe it also comes alive on the track  i wouldn 146t count so much on it  the audi has a nicer interior but is slower and  with sport suspension  rides more harshly while still not handling as well  to save some significant bucks check out the infiniti g35  in some ways a more entertaining if less technically excellent car  the g35 146s interior is significantly lower in quality  the new acura tl  priced like the g35 in the low 30s  has a better driving position and design  to my eye  and a sweet v6  but cannot touch the above cars in handling  the all but forgotten lexus is 300 is the opposite  it pairs agile handling with a tight  cheap looking  even tacky interior  a saab 9 3 aero is priced like the japanese  after rebates  but offers more precise handling together with good ride quality  its interior quality is below the germans  a touch below the acura  and above the g35  a cadillac cts is priced nearly as high as the bmw 3  but offers nearly as much interior space as the 5  some don 146t care for its level of interior quality  but i don 146t find it too objectionable  if anything the 2004 cts comes too close to replicating the 3 146s chassis feel  as i 146d like more entertainment from it as well b last words  in the end there are no perfect cars in this class  the best car depends on your priorities in performance  handling  ride  refinement  interior room  interior quality  and styling  the bmw comes closer than any of the others to excelling on all fronts  but i cannot help wishing it were fitted with a more driver oriented  more interesting interior  quicker steering  and a more entertaining suspension  maybe the next 3 with an unbundled m tuned suspension and active steering i must admit that the 330 truly came alive on a track  the problem is i don 146t spend much of my time driving a car that hard  if you do  then my issues do not apply  i neglected to mention how well i did in the final  timed lap  heading into it  fresh from doing everything wrong on the instructional laps  i feared ending up dead last  well  out of twelve drivers i placed totally mid pack  sixth  if only i 146d had a few more laps to unlearn a few more of my bad habits 133 my reviews of related vehicles b a href content 116178587268 acura tl a b b a href content 77238210180 audi a4 3 0 a b b a href content 67800436356

but the car was pursuing technical excellence fun and technical excellence are not the same thing  ve written quite  bit about my mixed emotions towards the series before for this review  ll

466;camera; digital cameras have come a long way since i got my first one in 1992  back then  they were black and white  grayscale in computer terms  but black and white in photographic terms  had poor resolution  were expensive  were slow  and transferring images to a pc was an ordeal  this camera shows just how far the medium has come in a bit over a decade the visioneer mx200 is an entry level digital camera  while it lacks the features found in more expensive cameras  it still boasts a 2 megapixel resolution  which is sufficient to produce clear  sharp pictures up to 8 by 10 inches  it sports an lcd display  which is de rigeur for digital cameras these days  it has 8mb of internal memory  which in theory can hold up to 66 pictures in  normal  resolution  however  in  super  resolution  it can hold seven  there are also three intermediate resolutions with intermediate capacities   super  resolution can be thought of as normal resolution compared to the better digital cameras on the market  so if you want clear  sharp prints that can survive cropping or enlarging to 8 by 10  then you better stick to the maximum resolution  which is 2048 1536 although the memory issue seems like a limitation  the camera supports smartmedia cards  a 128mb card cost me  39 with a  10 rebate  29 net  and that brought the capacity up to 145  super  resolution pictures  if you want more capacity  you can buy several cards  use lower resolution  or just upload the pictures to your computer more frequently  if you are satisfied with 4 by 6 snapshots or plan to use the camera for web photos only  then the internal memory at normal resolution should be adequate  and a similar smartmedia card can give you about 900 photos the camera comes with a built in flash  settings for white balance and flash  including an automatic one for each  a macro setting  and a setting for portraits  landscapes  and night scenes  as well as a self timer  the camera can also be used in pc mode as a pc camera with applications such as microsoft netmeeting  the camera can record video clips up to one minute long  albeit without sound there is also a 3 1 digital zoom  as with many digital cameras  a digital zoom is a poor substitute for an optical one  i read elsewhere that since the number of pixels in the ccd is fixed  the camera must make use of an algorithm to map zoomed pixels onto the ccd  and unless the zoom amount is an even multiple  you end up losing quality  likewise  if you decide to just crop the picture later  you will lose quality since editing a jpeg and saving it as a jpeg causes loss of resolution  needless to say you cannot find analog zoom on any cameras in this price range as of this writing  however  i did find that photos taken without the zoom appeared to be of better quality the camera comes with a case  strap  usb cable  video cable  for tv hookup  software  instructions  and dead batteries  customer support acknowledged that many users reported that the batteries were dead after only two or three pictures  mine did not last so long and the camera told me to change my batteries before i took a single picture according to the documentation  the camera should be used with alkaline batteries only  in another area  it says that it comes with alkaline or nimh batteries   it comes with alkalines  in yet another section  it states that alkaline or nimh batteries should be used  alkaline batteries are not very useful in this camera  if you use them  you will need to keep the lcd screen off  and you will run out of batteries after a dozen pictures or so  if you leave the camera on by mistake  it happened to me once when the button got pushed even though it was in the case  then you might get only two pictures from a set of alkaline batteries  i bought a set of nimh batteries and a charger for  5 99 and the camera has been doing fine ever since  the battery life rating i gave referred to the batteries supplied or any aa alkaline batteries used to replace them  if you try to take flash pictures with alkaline batteries  be prepared to turn the camera off afterwards to let the batteries rest before you can use it again the camera accepts an ac adapter  but there is no mention of it in the documentation  the visioneer website mentions that you can use a 3v 1000ma converter  it does not say the plug size or that it needs to be a converter with dc output  however  once the support person gave me the model number of an adapter from radio shack that works  i was able to find out most of what i need to know   such adapters come with multiple plugs or entitle the user to a plug that fits the unit in the case of radio shack  other parts related to the functionality of the camera are lacking in the documentation  for example  the explanation of the status led says that you can take a picture when it is a solid green  but you must wait when it is blinking  however  it does not say why the camera does not work when the led is amber  i will update this section if i ever find that out the documentation says that the camera features  advanced stepless digital zoom  superior adz  but there is no explanation of what adz tm  is  the instructions for the preset modes neglect to tell you how to get to them  you must first set the dial to pre set  this may be obvious when you have the camera and are used to it  but if you read the manual ahead of time  or without the camera in front of you  it makes no sense the troubleshooting section of the documentation is far from comprehensive  and if you have enough savvy to know how to check the batteries  there is a battery level indicator on the screen  but it s obviously useless if your batteries are completely dead  turn the unit off and make sure that the memory card is in correctly  it s of little use customer support is fair  there is an on line web based system that tells you much of what is left out of the manual  but not nearly enough  when i spoke to the customer support folks  they were not able to tell me much beyond what is available on line  what they did tell me in some cases  if accurate  did not instill confidence  in the case of the ac adapter  i was told that all they know is what was in their database and it came from a customer who tried it and it worked  when i told them that what the website said was inadequate  they did not seem concerned with updating it when it comes to getting photos to your computer  the task is painless  if you load the drivers from the cd  then windows will detect the camera as it does with any plug and play device  the camera will then appear as an external drive  and you can copy pictures using standard windows tools  i did not test this with a mac  but it should work  the camera will organize photos in folders by date  there will be a subdirectory for each date on which photos were taken  and photos within the directory will have a name composed of the date and a serial number  07280001 jpg would be the first photo taken on 7 28th  the camera also comes with  digital camera utility  software that allows you to select and download photos  however  the software is not rich enough in features to warrant any sort of praise  nor did i feel that i really needed it  if you already have software for viewing and editing images  it s not an issue when i got my first digital camera  i was beta testing it for logitech  it was the first consumer oriented digital camera on the market  it lacked features  and could not handle many contrast situations  for example  photographing african americans was not possible if you wanted facial features to be discernable  by contrast  in high resolution  this camera will produce images and prints up to 8 by 10 inches that rival that of a good  but not professional quality  35 mm camera  that s assuming that you do not zoom  and you compose the picture properly and use the proper settings  however  the default settings will work as well as one would would expect from many cameras with automated settings  and the lcd display will give you an idea of what to expect if you use other settings the bottom line is that it s a cheap camera that takes good pictures in the camera s most basic mode  it will not compare in quality to a high end digital camera  but if you are used to an inexpensive 35mm camera and wish to go digital  this should be more than adequate  be prepared to spend a bit more on memory  30 50  batteries and charger  6 30  and an ac adapter  12 20  ultimately  if you want the convenience of longer usage  the ability to leave it plugged into your pc  and the ability to store more photos  the price can easily double  so check out whether more expensive models come with these features as standard before you decide if this is the camera for you  that s especially true if you may need to buy an aftermarket image editing tool that may come for free with a more expensive camera  ; digital camera have come  long way since  got my first one in back then they were black and white grayscale in computer terms but black and white in photographic terms had poor resolution

481;camera; olympus 146 newly introduced cutting edge camedia c 5050 five megapixel digital camera takes the ongoing evolution of digital photography to a completely new plateau  olympus stretched digital imaging parameters by expanding the capabilities of the standard 1 1 8 148 ccd sensor to five million pixels  theoretically  making the pixels smaller  the only way to increase resolution without increasing ccd size  was expected to raise digital noise levels to an unacceptable level  olympus encouraged their engineers to think outside the box and strive for increased resolution from the standard sized ccd without increasing digital noise levels were they able to accomplish this goal  yes and no digital noise is present  as it is in all digitally generated images  but it is very well controlled  five megapixel images place huge demands on digital camera lenses  since the optics must sharply focus a much higher resolution image where even small distortions and aberrations are magnified many times  olympus wisely matched the proven f1 8 f2 6 35 105 zoom developed for the c3040 to their new five megapixel ccd  add a tilting lcd monitor  ala the canon g1 2 3 and the nikon coolpix 5000 and 5700  a tough magnesium alloy version of their standard  147c 148 series body  point and shoot ease of use  a full range of manual exposure options  and a wide array of creative applications and you 146ve got what may be the best prosumer digital camera ever introduced  throw in the ability to use three different image storage formats  xd picture card  smart media  and cf types i   ii and microdrives  and the creative possibilities are almost limitless the c 5050 can produce professional quality images  just set the camera to one of its manual exposure modes and compose carefully  while using the  147live 148 histogram display to adjust sharpening color saturation  and contrast  set the white balance for the prevailing lighting and save your images as an uncompressed raw file  if you need video clips  with audio  the c 5050 146s movie mode is limited only by the amount of memory available  if you want to maximize your creative options then you 146ll need to spend some quality time getting intimately familiar with the c 5050 146s operation  but if you just want to forget all that and be a snapshooter for an evening  or if you want your spouse to agree that you really really need a new five megapixel digital camera  then you can set the c 5050 to program and hand it over so they can shoot the kids birthday party without worrying about f stops and shutter speeds  but you may have some difficulty getting it back from them afterward   viewfinder lcd  the c 5050 features a real image optical viewfinder with a diopter correction for eyeglasses wearers  the high eyepoint optical viewfinder zooms with the lens the c 5050 has a bright 1 8  tilting lcd monitor that also provides detailed information on aperture  shutter speed  image quality  and camera exposure settings  the lcd screen also provides a  live  histogram display in any automatic exposure mode  program  aperture  and shutter priority  when enabled through the lcd menu  the histogram highlights over or underexposed areas of the image  allowing photographers to fine tune exposure for correct balance of highlights and shadows  shooters can also use the lcd screen to review

settings like focus mode  flash mode  drive mode  white balance  iso  exposure compensation  and image quality without using the battery draining lcd monitor  top deck lcd status screens are a real boon to digital photographers because they allow the battery drain from the lcd screen to be rigidly controlled by using the optical viewfinder and top deck lcd status screen rather than relying full time on the lcd monitor for exposure and status information  the c 5050 provides a very useful monochrome status lcd  but the c 5050 146s top deck status lcd isn 146t illuminated  which seems a

and film cameras and photographic equipment  has been trying to test as many newly introduced digital cameras as possible  which has kept the two of us pretty busy for the last month  a few weeks ago we tested the new olympus c 4000  which has been selling like hotcakes  and ever since he 146s been trying to get olympus 146 new five megapixel offerings  the c 50 and the c 5050  he was finally able to get the c 50 a couple of weeks ago and he got a c 5050 just before thanksgiving  the friday night after thanksgiving my friend took the c 5050 down to jefferson square to watch the annual  147light up louisville 148 festivities  he wasn 146t alone  over 100 000 people turned out to see the more than 1 000 000 christmas lights turn louisville 146s city county administrative district into a holiday wonderland  jefferson street in front of the courthouse temporarily becomes santa claus lane  after seeing the crowds on the tv news i was glad i chose to miss the chaos  after everything was over my friend took one look at the grid locked traffic and walked down to the foot of fourth street and spent half an hour shooting the christmas light bedecked  147belle of louisville 148 before finding his car and making his way home the shots of jefferson square were ok but nothing to write home about  the ninety year old red  white  and blue sternwheeler covered with christmas lights was an entirely different story  the old steamboat really turned out great the c 5050 turned in completely professional looking long exposures with great colors and no noticeable noise  i was really impressed when i saw the images of the belle on saturday afternoon  after it got dark we took the camera for a ride through the highlands and cherokee triangle neighborhoods to shoot christmas light displays in a couple of louisville 146s oldest and most interesting neighborhoods  we then drove down to  147old louisville 148 to shoot some of the hundreds of old victorian mansions along second  third  and fourth streets  the christmas lights in the highlands and old louisville may lack some of the  147over the top 148 drama present in our suburban displays  but they really dress up the wonderful old victorian houses  we also spent some time shooting some of the characters that make bardstown road come alive after dark on saturday night  the c 5050 did an incredible job  the built in flash works very well  147in close 148 for environmental portraits of bundled up skateboarders and goth music fans  the images  traditional victorian mansions with christmas lights   147woodpushers 148  and multi pierced goths  were all very well exposed with accurate colors and no detectable noise  we got together again on sunday morning to try some outdoor daylight shots  the weather was much better sunny and blue skies with patchy white clouds  but very cold  mid 20 146s  we bundled up and drove across the river to the falls of the ohio state park  just over the ohio river in clarksville  indiana  the park is the only place where you can actually see the 380 million year old devonian fossil beds  the exposed remains of an ancient reef  the reef used to form a short drop falls that impeded navigation on the ohio river  it was necessary to pull boats out of the river above the falls and  147portage 148 them  and their cargoes  to a site below the falls where they could be put back in the water  the  147portage 148 made the area the perfect site for a town general george rogers clark built a fort on sand island to protect kentucky  then a county in virginia  and control river traffic  that primitive little fort eventually became the city of louisville  next year the falls of the ohio will be a focal point for the three year lewis and clark bicentennial  the expedition to explore the louisiana purchase commenced its journey to the pacific from the falls of the ohio river  captain lewis joined co captain clark  the younger brother of louisville 146s founder george rogers clark  here  most of the corps of discovery party that accompanied lewis and clark to the pacific were from louisville  kentucky and jeffersonville  indiana  neither of us had been to the falls since mid summer  we wandered around for a couple of hours taking photos with the c 5050  and freezing our butts off  photography at the falls is much easier in the summer when the area is filled with an explosion of green growing things  hundreds of birds  dogs  kids  hikers  and fishermen  picture opportunities are much harder to find in early winter  we did get some nice shots of the louisville skyline from the fossil beds and we got a couple of good images of the fossil beds with some neat oblique afternoon lighting  the falls of the ohio state park is located at exit 0 on interstate 65  north  the c 5050 did just as well in bright daylight as it had done in the dark  the af assist light works beautifully  long exposures are a snap  no pun intended  and shutter lag  shot to shot times  and write to card times  especially if you use an xd picture card  are very quick b image quality  the c 5050 146s image quality is exceptional  easily as good or better than any five megapixel digital camera currently available  skin tones and colors are the most accurate i have seen to date and that has a lot to do with olympus 146 excellent image interpolation  all digital cameras use interpolation to balance colors and contrast  olympus redesigned the c 5050 146s interpolation software to produce more accurate colors and better contrast  my friend and i printed two 8x10 inch enlargements  from full sized jpeg files  on an epson stylus photo epx785 and they were both excellent  even when inspected with a 4x mamiya loupe  we also printed up a couple of shots from the falls at 5x7 and both were very good with accurate well saturated colors  excellent contrast  and tack sharp resolution  very impressive performance for the cheapest five megapixel digital camera currently available b a few concerns  the c 5050 146s optical viewfinder is a little tight  small  and you have to squash your nose against the lcd to use it  olympus could have done a better job here  the c 5050 has a really aggressive sharpening function at the default setting images tend to be hard edged and a little over sharp experiment with the minus settings until you find the level that works best for you  minus sharpening will also lower noise levels at the iso 100 setting  there is barely visible barrel distortion at the wide angle end of the c 5050 146s zoom range but pincushion distortion at the telephoto end of the zoom appears to be very well controlled  chromatic aberration is visible at the maximum aperture in high contrast scenes but can be easily controlled by using the histogram display to adjust contrast levels  or shoot at f4   conclusion  olympus is offering the c 5050 at a lower price than competing five megapixel digital cameras and that will oblige the other major manufacturers to improve their existing technology and offer new models that provide improved performance and incorporate proven components rather than introducing new technology  competition always benefits consumers because new technology is very very expensive to develop and consumers must pay the research and development costs  in addition  new technology always comes with bugs and first generation of consumers must act as the final stage of research and development at their own expense  if your digital camera is more than one year old then there are many reasons for upgrading  there have been many significant improvements including higher resolution and newer cameras are much faster  lcd screens are sharper and brighter and not as jerky  colors are truer and white balance is much improved  digital camera prices are the lowest they ve ever been  the camedia c 5050 is targeted toward advanced amateur and casual pro users who want manual control and advanced features  images from the c5050 are as good or better than the images from any 5 megapixel digital camera i have used  and in the final analysis image quality really is  147job one 148  everything else is just icing on the cake  to put a bit more of an emphasis on that statement  the c 5050 represents a real advance in the digital imaging evolution with the fastest lens  f 1 8  of any currently available digital camera  very good low light performance  lots of user input  an almost infinite variety of image adjustment options  and lots of serious image enhancing features  the c 5050 is worthy of serious consideration from anyone looking for a pro quality five megapixel imaging tool at a prosumer digi cam price  ; polypus newly introduced cutting edge camelia  five megapixel digital camera takes the going evolution of digital photography to  completely new plateau polypus stretched digital imagine parameter by expanding the capabilities of the standard cod senior to five million pipes theoretical making the pipes smaller the only way to increase resolution without increasing cod size was expected to raise digital noise levels to an unacceptable level polypus encouraged their engineers to think outside the box and strive for increased resolution from the standard sized cod without increasing digital noise levels were they able to accomplish this goal yes and no digital noise is present as it is in all digital generate images but it is very well controlled five megapixel images place huge demands on digital camera lenses since the optic must sharply focus  much higher resolution image where even small distortion and aberrations are magnified many times polypus wisely matched the prove   room developed for the  to their new five megapixel cod add  tilting led monitor all the canon  and the union coolpix and  tough magnesium allow version of their standard  series body point and shoot ease of use  full range of manual exposure option

alternatives to chevy or ford  and the dodge viper consistently makes the top ten where performance is concerned  the jeep liberty is a ten fold improvement over the cherokee it replaces  but what about the sedans   names like sebring  stratus  intrepid  and concorde don t seem to ring any bells with many consumers  again  not for a lack of good products   those cars are all fine choices  but seem to suffer from an anonymity of sorts a perfect case in point is the chrysler 300m  typically  chryslers have been more about luxury than performance  the 300m seeks to blend the two in keeping

them  an analog clock with the same chrome treatment  and a beautiful wood an leather steering wheel  although the steering wheel has many cruise control buttons  they do not light up at night  forcing the driver to take his her eyes off the road for just a second  the instrument cluster glows in a backlit neon bluish tint that feels both modern and retro at the same time  the luxury side of

much of the interior has a quality feel  much of the dash and console area seem cheap by comparison  on the road  the 300m lives up to its performance heritage with firm suspension and plenty of power  sure  a 300m should have 300 hp  but 250 is plenty  the 300m is powered by a 3 5 liter v6  and while 250 hp is  in fact plenty  this car lacks the all out grunt of the much more expensive cadillac

on other sport luxury sedans such as the deville dts  lexus gs  and infinity i35  hard cornering is nothing short of fun in the 300m  and while it s easy to make horsepower comparisons to cadillacs costing  10 20 000 more  the 300m will out handle most any sedan with the possible exception of an audi or bmw  comparing an audi to a chrysler  surely the grumbling has begun  but the 300m isn t just an appearance package  it s really a stiff and sporty car  when pressed hard  the nose has a tendency to push in the corners  but such is the nature of front wheel drive cars  remember  this is a car that can make spirited driving a blast  but still carry 5 adults comfortably  there is a slight price to pay for the 300m s agile cornering ability  on rough roads  the 300m s ride seems a bit harsh  lacking the softness of an acura or lexus  however both acura and lexus sedans are prone to much more body roll than the 300  continuing the sport theme is chrysler s autostick  auto manual

494;auto; i had just started a new job  i m in sales  and i need a car that would be reliable and something i could feel good about owning  my first new car was a 1994 chevy cavalier  which i never regretted buying because of both it s appearance and performance  i wanted to do the same with this car  my wife s family swears by honda and i have always been impressed when i see older hondas that still look sharp and not outdated  honda also has a good reputation for durability  we originally were looking at honda civic to fit in with my newlywed  new job budget  however  they were trying to unload the 2002 accords to get the 2003 s in  read  excuse to tell you that you are getting a good price on the car  so we went with the accord  the reason that we chose the special edition was because my wife really liked the model  it is a sharp looking car  we got the black coupe  without the  flap   spoiler  i am proud to own it from that standpoint  and we did get a good deal  the special edition gives you  aluminum rims  am fm cassette cd stereo w  6 speakers  adjustable seats raise and lower  moon roof and cruise control performance has given me mixed feelings  i do drive the car alot  14 000 miles in 6 months  it doesn t have alot of power  take off speed is often slow  especially if the car hasn t had a chance to warm up  going up hills is a big concern for me because i live in a hilly town  i got stuck on my first hill here in the winter  i started from a dead stop on an upgrade and barely made it up  i never had any problems like that before  i never thought i was getting a race car  but i expected a little more than that the windows fog at every given opportunity as well  what is even more strange is using the air conditioner over the heater gets rid of it quicker  the stereo is top notch  i was ready to replace it right off the bat  but it can be loud if you need it loud and the sound is good with the six speaker system another good feature is the inability to lock your keys in the car  if the keys are in the ignition  and you hit lock on the car either by manually pressing the lock stick down or the all lock button  and you shut the door  it will automatically unlock overall the car is nice  but i think i paid too much for it  even at 18 000  the real test will be after i have hit 100 000 miles and what the car looks like then  ;  had just started  new job   in sales and  need  car that would be reliable and something  could feel good about owning my first new car was  they cavalier which  never regretted buying because of both it  appearance and performance  wanted to do the same with this car my wife  family swears by hand and  have always been impressed when  see older hands that still look sharp and not outdated hand also has  good reputation for disability we originally were looking at hand civic to fit in with my newlywed new job budget however they were trying to unload the accord to get the  in read excuse to tell you that you are getting  good price on the car so we went with the accord the reason that we chose the special edition was because my wife really liked the model it is  sharp looking car we got the black couple without the flap spoiled  am proud to own it from that standpoint and we did get  good deal the special edition gives you aluminium aims am am cassette d sterno  speakers adjustable seats raise and lower moon roof and cruise control performance has given me mixed feelings  do drive the car clot miles in months it doesn  have clot of power take off speed is often slow especially if the car hasn  had  chance to warm up going up hills is  big concern for me because  live in  hilly town  got stuck on my first hill here in the winter  started from  dead stop on an upgrade and barely made it up  never had any problems like that before  never thought  was getting  race car but  expected  little more than that the windows fog at every given opportunity as well what is even more strange is using the air conditioned over the theater gets rid of it quicker the sterno is top notch  was ready to replace it right off the bat but it can be loud if you need it loud and the sound is good with the six speaker system another good feature is the inability to lock your keys in the car if the keys are in the munition and you hit lock on the car either by mentally pressing the lock stick down or the all lock button and you shut the door it will automatically clock overall the car is nice but  think  paid too much for it even at the real test will be after  have hit miles and what the car looks like then 
495;auto; i ve now had my 2002 aerio for 15 000 miles  and can bring to you a review with some experience behind it the pros the aerio is definitely inexpensive compared with other similar cars out there  standard  the aerio has cruise control  air conditioning  power windows  power mirror adjustment  in dash cd player  foglamps and a trunk organizer that is just fabulous  i looked at several other similarly priced featured models  and found them to be underfeatured or overpriced compared to the aerio every time  i was particularly shocked with the ford focus wagon  which i felt was a terrible value  it rattled and creaked while driving  was underpowered and poorly designed and ford had few incentives to buy  on the other hand  the mazda protege 5 is a wonderful car with good features  but comprably equipped it is much more expensive than the aerio  i believe the aerio is a great value the aerio has a lot of room and is a very easy car to live with  the seats are comfortable in front and back  and my basketball playing  6 7ft tall  friends have commended it on the ample backseat leg and headroom  the rear seats both fold down for transporting stuff  and can be adjusted back in three positions  from nearly erect to a slightly reclined position  for the comfort of your passengers  the rear seats have a fold down armrest with a cup holder  which my passengers like  for storage  the aerio has a large glove compartment  a drawer under the front passenger seat  shallow door pockets in front  three cupholders in the console  two in front  one in back  magazine pockets on the back of the front seats  a pocket in the very back  and one of my favorite features  a multi compartment storage area under the rear deck that includes an integrated bucket  you know all that stuff that seems to build up in your trunk  you can store it in here  making for a neater car and keeping it handy at the same time  with the seats folded down for stowing  i have been surprised at what will fit in back  i have fit a 32  tv  in box  a full size whirlpool clothes dryer  not to mention several tables and other stuff  short of an suv or pickup  the aerio has a lot of space for the price the aerio is an economical car to drive  powered by a 141 hp  2 0 liter  inline 4  the aerio gets about 26 mpg in the city and 33 mpg on the highway  i ve found that it s important to keep an eye on the aerio s tire pressure or these numbers plummet fast  the aerio comes backed with an excellent warranty as well  and the success of the car ensures plentiful parts for years to come  the aerio is fun to drive  i d describe the engine as  peppy  in that i  leadfoot  rarely feel like my need for speed is being denied  when needing extra juice for a high speed merge or pass  a tromp on the gas is all it takes and the aerio takes off with aplomb  when the a c is running  the pep is a little more restrained  but not too much  ride is better than i would expect from a car this economical  but it s not perfect  there is road  tire and engine noise present at all speeds  but not to the point that it is bothersome  in my opinion  if you are looking for a dead quiet ride  i recommend mercedes  d  the handling is not sports car quality  either  but predictable and reliably solid  the turning radius is quite tight  making for easy quick parking  u turns and other maneuvers  seat comfort is good  i ve driven it 10 hours nonstop without causing much soreness or bother  the dashboard of the aerio might take a little getting used to  but it makes sense  the digital readout is a little strange but is completely functional and well designed  the heating ac switches are easy to understand  as is the stereo  windshield wiper and cruise controls  the a c  when running full blast  is cold  i strongly suspect an 8 year old could drive the aerio  it s that simple  the neutrals much has been said about the aerio s look  some say it s ugly  some say it s wierd  i say it looks just fine for me the cons as mentioned above  the aerio is not the most insular of rides  bad roads will be felt and heard while driving  just as good roads make for a very pleasant ride  suzuki makes a  100 center console armrest for the aerio  i believe this should come included as it would increase driving comfort significantly a pet peeve of mine is that the a c always runs when the front defog defroster is on  while this makes it work very well  i would have preferred to have the choice of running the defog defrost and a c together rather than having them linked  the rear tray that covers the luggage area is a little flimsy  i no longer use it at all  but this is because when i did  it became clear that taking it out and replacing it often would probably lead to its breaking in the near future when i be jammin  to loud music  the door speakers can sometimes vibrate  causing a buzzing noise  otherwise  the stereo is great  and i ve discovered that the buzzing stops if one cracks each window a centimeter or so the mesh used on the seats and doors seems to hold soil more than other fabrics  but  all in all  after my first 15 000 miles  i can make the following conclusions    i love my aerio   i drive my aerio whenever i can  my wife hardly drives anymore    the aerio is an excellent value    the aerio is versatile   great for moving stuff  road trips  and passengers    the aerio is fun  ;  ve now had my period for miles and can bring to you  review with some experience behind it the pro the period is definitely expensive compared with other similar

501;camera; are you one of those people who purchased a webcam or a digital camera five years ago and considered yourself a leader  have you upgraded that purchase since then  if not  you might be surprised to find what is out there and the functions that have been added to make the webcam experience and the digital camera experience more fun my fiance has long pushed me to purchase an  inexpensive  digital camera  one that we could on vacations or to the shore and not worry about it every second of the trip  yet one that still took decent photos  sure  you can try the throw away digital cameras  but the photo quality is still lacking  hence  the smile on my face when i came upon the logitech clicksmart 420  solid digital camera that will not break the bank the specifics  up to 1 3 megapixel pictures  8 megabytes internal flash memory  storage for over 80 pictures and 70 seconds of video  video capture resolution of 320 x 240 as a digital camera  video capture resolution of 640 x 480 pixels as a webcam  built in microphone and tripod options  picture formats include jpeg and avi  four aaa batteries  one touch flash  delete  and timer functions  wrist strap and lens cover there are other specifics that are more important to the serious photographer  but i did not list them  the reason is that this is a not a digital camera for the serious photographer  the 420 is a solid digital camera that is probably not going to be the best camera that you own what i like 1  ease of use  the 420 is almost all one touch  you can delete pictures with one touch and set the flash and timer functions with just a touch  you can also take a photo and send an email with just a single touch  heck  downloading the software is just a few steps more than a single touch  anyone can learn and use this in a short period of time 2  the price quality debate  like i mentioned  this is not a great camera  but for the price i would argue that it is pretty good  the photos and options are not going to be as good as what you get with your  1 000 00 digital camera  but they will be fairly good  from time to time i will find that i get a photo that is not of great quality  so what  with a digital camera you simply delete it and try again  considering that you are paying less than  100 for the 420  i think you will agree that the quality is pretty good 3  the ability to send photos over the internet  this has always been one of the more annoying aspects of the digital camera for me  i purchased my parents a  800 digital camera last christmas and we still struggle with the picture sharing function  the 420 makes things fairly easy  you have the usb cable and the docking station and then the software  then you simply take a photo or video as you would normally and save it  finally  you put the camera in the docking station and select the picture or video you want to email and click the send button  that is it and the beauty of it is that it works  you can also send to a mac or a pc 4  the durability  ok  this is the reason we bought the 420  the 420 has rounded edges that make a drop less painful and a rubber and plastic casing that make the drop harmless  the pieces are put together well enough that you can drop the camera on the beach and not suffer from sand ruining things  now let me back up a second and mention that we have not tried these things  but you can feel the tautness of the design and the durability that the rubber provides  5  we are not there yet  but a great camera for kids  first of all  the durability mentioned above makes the 420 a nice camera for kids  secondly  the rounded edges mean less likelyhood of a nasty fall  thirdly  the large buttons provide for ease of use  finally  the one touch operation makes the 420 easy to learn  hence  the 420 is truly a good camera for a child 6  the dual function of webcam digital camera  i do not use the webcam function all that often  but when i do i like a webcam that i can depend on  oftentimes this will depend on what service you are using  aol  msn  yahoo  etc  but it also often depends on the webcam itself  the 420 works with all the major im platforms and provides video and audio options along with the standard chat  the webcam option provides a clear picture on both ends of the spectrum  a big change  no longer are you stuck with a webcam that needs a bright light in order for the other person to see you  hallelujah and again the webcam function is very easy to use 7  the memory is pretty good  you can save 80 pictures without downloading and that is more than i will ever have on a camera at a single time  remember  if you do not like a photo you can delete it  finding 80 pictures that you like  from say a single trip  is a lot  the same goes for the 70 seconds of video  while this is not a lot of time  it is enough to capture a video of something unexpected or special that you otherwise would have missed  8  customer service  i am not sure that is the right term for what i mean  but it will have to work  logitech has always provided me with a good customer service option  the people people know what they are talking about and the wait is usually not too long  i also find that the two year product guarantee is a nice touch  i doubt i will need to use the customer service line or the guarantee  but it is nice to know that both are available and useful what i do not like 1  the batteries  the 420 runs on four aaa batteries  you can take a decent amount of pictures  but the video function is going to drain the battery quickly  aside from keeping the cost down  i am not sure why logitech did not go ahead and utilize a better battery  2  the memory is  pretty  good  aside from keeping the cost down  i am not sure why logitech did not provide the option of a memory stick or something similar in order to expand the available memory  i will never go over the 80 pictures that can be saved  but you may  in this day and age  logitech dropped the ball by not including this option with the 420 the bottom line we purchased the logitech clicksmart 420 as a second digital camera webcam and it has met our high expectations  we wanted something that we would not stress about while on vacation  we did not want to have to worry about it on the beach or fret over it falling out of the golf cart  we wanted a good camera that would do what we asked of it  take a decent picture  be trouble free  and easy to use  finally  we did not want to spend a lot of money since this was going to be a second camera for us i would highly recommend the 420 for someone looking for a solid second camera  a starter digital camera  or a camera for a child  the 420 is easy to use  durable  and priced reasonably  ; are you one of those

510;auto; i have found my inner child  and he s a thirteen year old boy  this is a tremendous discovery for someone s mother to make  if you ask me  but i think it s true  the whole thing started because my old mazda rx 7 needed work  a lot of work  i owned the car outright  but it had reached the age where it was going to take thousands of dollars a couple of times a year to keep it driving anything like i wanted  despite argument from my significant other  my emotional attachment to the rx 7   my first ever fun car   was such that i really did plan to just keep fixing it again and again  or else replace it with a newer rx 7 if i could find one  well  just as i was about to finally bite the bullet and get major transmission work done on the rx 7  my main squeeze threw me and our two year old son in his van  and took me out to a car lot where  side by side  sat a used corvette and a newer rx 7 turbo  i test drove the rx 7  and found it similar to the one i already had  only with absolutely zero cargo space  i planned to test drive the vette  but they d locked the keys in the car  inspired  though  i headed to the chevy dealership to see if they had any used vettes  and they did   but not in my price range  to my surprise  though  the showroom floor camaro ss was available at a price i could talk myself into  giggling a little inside  i took a camaro ss for a test drive  i was surprised by how much i liked it  tons of zip  enough cargo space to pick up a reasonable load of groceries if i needed to  comfortable seats that were even big enough for my son s car seat  if only i liked the way it looked  i thanked the chevy dealer for the test drive  and headed up the street to the pontiac dealer  where i found a bargain  a low miles  bright red 1995 trans am  six speed with the hurst shifters  half the price of the new camaro ss  so i took that one for a ride too first of all  i have bad knees  so a few years ago  i came to grips with the notion that i wouldn t be driving stick anymore  it had been years  but it came right back driving that fun car  a little slow stop and start around surface streets  then out onto the highway and next thing i know  there i am in 6th  severely over the speed limit at 1500 rpm  i took the car out of gear  got off the freeway  and went back to the dealership  angel on one shoulder saying  quot but remember  you can t drive stick anymore  remember your knees shaking in traffic quot  and devil on the other saying   quot who cares  who cares  this car rules quot  this  like i say  is where the teenage boy comes in i looked at every trans am on that lot  unlike the camaros  they didn t have any automatics in stock  i worked that dealer  had him showing me every little feature of every trans am  and then i got back in the aged rx 7 and  responsibly  drove home without buying a stick but back at the house  i started my trans am research in earnest  i was intrigued to compare firebirds and camaros  learning that more camaros are made than firebirds  that a larger percentage of women buy firebirds than camaros  while the opposite is true of camaros  i walked around for a few days saying things like  quot hey  it s a version of the corvette engine quot  and  quot i think traction control would be a major plus quot  and  quot okay  can you explain the difference between gear ratio and axle ratio quot just like that  i d managed to tell myself i could sever my emotional bond with my rx 7  and i knew that i wanted to replace it with a hefty american v8  for a new  sporty car  that meant i had 3 options  firebird  camaro  or mustang  for a slightly used car  a corvette frankly  i just don t like the looks of the new mustang at all  and to get the same horsepower that are standard with a camaro or firebird  i would have had to spring for a mustang svt cobra  with a higher sticker price than i wanted to pay for a car whose looks i don t like  and which i constantly see lots of on the road anyway  what s more  i fail to see why the absolute top of the line mustang  the svt cobra r  actually gets any play when you could buy a new corvette for the same price  people actually pick a mustang over a vette  ford must have some advertising whizzes  but naaaah  the mustang was never a contender for me the used corvette was  however  after a fair amount of contemplation  i decided that what i really wanted to do was buy my first brand new car  where i got to pick out the colour and everything  and it came with a solid warranty and no miles on it and it would be mine from the very beginning  so  back to camaro vs  firebird  first of all  the base v6 was right out  i m sure it s a great car  but after driving the 305 horsepower v8s  i had to have one  i didn t even bother to test drive the 200 horsepower v6 firebird or camaro  if i d been in the market for a v6  however  either the camaro or the firebird would have been a hands down win over the v6 mustang  which i ve rented and  frankly  enjoyed less than a camry   which is too bad  because i wanted to like the mustang  deciding between the camaro and firebird ended up being easier than one might think  while i liked the way the camaro handled  and its features and options  and while the price was right and there were plenty of camaro sses around that were automatic transmission  the bottom line is i liked the looks of the trans am better  it took me the better part of a week to find an automatic trans am to test drive  to be sure i liked the way the automatic transmission felt  deep down  the teenage boy inside me kept hollering the whole time   quot you don t care  so what about your knees  get this one  get it  get it  yeah  don t drive the dying rx 7 off this lot quot when i finally found one  it was an automatic trans am with the ws6 performance package on it  and it was a 2001  which meant i wouldn t be able to take advantage of the  1500 rebate for the 2000 model year  and the bottom line there was that the car was just a little more expensive than i really wanted to pay  for features that i wasn t likely to ever really capitalize on   17 quot  wheels  15 more horses  and the functional scoops with tougher looking hood  for example i ended up picking out an automatic trans am to be delivered from about a hundred miles away  with the only options being chromed wheels  traction control  and the  quot performance axle quot  with the 3 23 ratio  while the waiting for the car to be delivered was sheer torture  i could not be happier with the vehicle first of all  i m thrilled with its pure oomph  i m learning to drive all over again   if i drive this car the way i drove the rx 7  i m going to get arrested  step anything but lightly on the accelerator when the light turns green  and the tires will squeal  this car is very quick off the line   the same kind of driving that would keep me reasonably in step with other cars before now leaves me seeing them far back in the rear view mirror  of course  this means i ve got to be vigilant if i m not the first one up at the light   pickup is exceptional  even at highway speeds  this means the car really is terrific in california freeway traffic  if i need to be somewhere else  fast  it s no problem  it s great to have the power to accelerate out of potentially sticky situations even when the overall flow of traffic is already exceeding the speed limit  i m also very happy with braking  since i don t have downshifting for an added measure of control  in an automatic  and the car s overall responsiveness  take a week of silicon valley driving  and you re guaranteed a few chances to find out how your car reacts to adverse traffic scenarios  while i ve heard complaints about visibility  i have to say it s superior to what i had in the rx 7  yes  the rear window is short  so you don t get a tall view of the road there  and that takes some getting used to  as does seeing the rear spoiler in the reflection  however  the side mirrors are excellent  and the glance over the shoulder blind spot is much smaller than the one i had with the rx 7  which was enough of a blind spot to hide an entire geo metro  ask me how i learned that one  i didn t get the driver s seat with lumbar support  just the basic 6 way power seat  if i were expecting to do nonstop roadtrips  or if i already had back problems  i would likely have opted for the upgraded seat  but i m perfectly happy with this one  and suspect i would be even for the occasional roadtrip  however  i expect a passenger would want to make more frequent stops to stretch his legs  given the lump in the floor which i understand hides the catalytic converter  and no one but a child could make a roadtrip in this vehicle as a back seat passenger speaking of children  my son s toddler car seat fits quite nicely in the back  and there are tether strap anchor points for two car seats  while i think his view was better from the passenger seat of the two seater rx 7  in the trans am he can watch all the mirrors and has the view out the tinted glass t tops  although he does tend to kick the passenger seat some  he s got enough room to be comfortable  and his major problem appears to be when we stop   he will start screaming   quot go  go  go  car quot  i also find that it s nice to be able to reach easily to hand him things and so forth  without having to tell him to keep his hand off the shifter and not kick the stereo  like in a 2 seater  and of course  i love it that now all three people in our family can go for a ride in the fun car at once  the stereo is great  i did not opt for the 12 cd changer  figuring that if i do someday decide i want one  i can probably find one that will work with the car s head unit for under  600  the price of the factory installed changer  i m definitely going to get spoiled by the radio controls on the steering wheel  too i m thrilled with the t tops as an open air alternative to a convertible  lots more openness than even a huge power moonroof gave me on the rx 7  and little enough wind turbulence that  even though i have three feet of hair  i am comfortable and hair doesn t get blown in my face  restricting my vision  an equally long haired passenger reported the same thing  i ve been advised  about the t tops  to unlatch them in the event that the car ever needs to be jacked up  so as to avoid any potential torque being applied to that part of the car  which could result in a leaky t top  by the same token  the manual says never to take the car through a car wash that sprays high pressure water in the area of the t tops  so it looks like this will be a wash by hand car forever  what s more  the manual says the chromed wheels are prone to damage by brushes in a car wash  so i guess i ll be washing it and making periodic visits to the upscale car detailers  though classified as a sub compact  this is a bigger car than you would think  it s nearly as long as my main squeeze s extended gmc safari  and weighing in at 3500 pounds  almost as much as a coupe deville and more than a chevy s 10 pickup   this car weighs as much as some suvs  so you can t drive it like you would a lightweight vehicle  nor does this vehicle get subcompact gas mileage  for silicon valley traffic driving  admittedly with the air conditioning on  i seem to be getting about 17 miles to the gallon the list of standard features on a trans am is truly exceptional  especially for the price  no  it doesn t have the full complement of luxury sedan features  but one wouldn t expect it to  but the list of standard equipment is long enough that it barely fits in the section for it on the car s window sticker  overall  i would wholeheartedly recommend this car to anyone who wants a fun  fast car  with a few caveats  you won t be able to fit a huge amount of cargo in it  though it s got adequate space  you won t be able to carry around a gaggle of your friends  and it will be anything but cheap to fill it with the premium gas the manual sternly recommends  additionally  i would not recommend this car to an inexperienced driver  the steep rake angle of the hood makes it hard to get a feel for where the car ends  and similarly  it s hard to know this moving in reverse  further  with the major amount of oomph right at all speeds i ve driven so far  and a top speed that s supposed to be 160 mph  i would not recommend this for a driver who is inexperienced or prone to recklessness   which is bad news  i suppose  for teenage boys who aren t inner children br br  ;  have found my inner child and he   thirteen year old boy this is  tremendous discovery for someone  mother to make if you ask me but  think it  true the whole thing started because my old made re needed work  lot of work  owned the car outright but it had reached the age where it was going to take thousands of dollars  couple of times  year to keep it driving anything like  wanted despite argument from my significant other my emotional attachment to the re my first ever fun car was such that  really did plan to just keep fixing it again and again or else replace it with  newer re if  could find one well just as  was about to finally bite the bullet and get major transmission work done on the re my main squeeze threw me and our two year old son in his van and took me out to  car lot where side by side sat  used coquette and  newer re turn  test drove the re and found it similar to the one  already had only with absolutely zero cargo space  planned to test drive the cette but they  locked the keys in the car inspired though  headed to the they leadership to see if they had any used vetoes and they did but not in my price range to my surprise though the showroom floor camera is was available at  price  could talk myself into tingling  little inside  took  camera is for  test drive  was surprised by how much  liked it tons of zip enough cargo space to pick up  reasonable load of groceries if  needed to comfortable seats that were even big enough for my son  car seat if only  liked the way it looked  thanked the they dealer for the test drive and headed up the street to the pontiac dealer where  found  bargain  low miles bright red trans am six speed with the burst sisters half the price of the new camera is so  took that one for  ride too first of all  have bad knees so  few years ago  came to grip with the notion that  wouldn  be driving stick anymore it had been years but it came right back driving that fun car  little slow stop and start around surface streets then out onto the highway and next thing  know there  am in th severely over the speed limit at rum  took the car out of gear got off the freely and went back to the leadership angel on one shoulder saying quit but

515;camera; as the heir apparent to the c 2500l from olympus  i expected great things from the c 2100uz  my expectations were  perhaps  a little too high the c 2100 features a 10x optical zoom  this is far better than most other consumer and prosumer cameras  digital or not  it uses smartmedia for storage and ships with an 8mb card  a lens cover and shoulder strap are included  four aa nimh

therfore only usb equipped machines running windows 98  windows 2000 or mac os 9 will work with the camera  olympus makes a point of noting that even usb equipped machines that have been upgraded to windows 98 from windows 95 will not work with the camera  an a v cable is supplied for connecting to televisions and vcrs the maximum resolution of the camera is 1600x1200 or 2 1 megapixels  this is less than other current leading edge cameras feature  the camera can save in tiff or jpeg and can also capture short  30 sec  quicktime movie clips with sound at 15 frames per second  a continuous drive mode can capture about seven super high quality shots in about four seconds time  that does not include the time it takes to save the images to the memory card  an infra red remote is included for timed shots the c 2100uz is styled as an slr camera  cameras in this category are identified by their ability to accurately frame pictures by using through the lens  ttl  view finders  while this makes a big difference on traditional film cameras  it is not as big a selling point on digital cameras which use lcd displays that by their very nature display ttl images that can be used for framing a shot  of the few slr digital cameras available  the benfefit to the ttl viewfinder is that the image is purely optical  that is  you can see all the detail that a lcd screen cannot display  the c 2100 breaks this tradition by using a miniature lcd in the viewfinder instead of optics  this gives the camera a video camera type of feel  the benefit of this setup is the massive amount of setting information that can be displayed while framing a picture  including the effects of exposure compensation  the drawback is the lack of fine detail that true optics provide  back to the benefits  playback can be done on the viewfinder s lcd which uses far less power than the large rear mounted lcd  a button switches the display between the mini lcd and the large lcd at any time during capture or playback the camera s imaging sensor  ccd  supports iso equivalent sensitivities of 100  200 and 400  in point and shoot mode  the camera can select between these settings automatically  expect a tendency to use a higher film speed when set to auto mode  as with all digital cameras  there is a significant amount of image noise captured when higher speeds are used the manual controls for shutter speed  aperture and manual focus are very flexible  more flexible than even the c 2500l s controls  the manual focus control could have been made a little easier to use  although its feature of enlarging the image to show more detail while adjusting is handy  shutter priority and aperture priority modes are available in addition to a full manual mode  a handful of special modes are available under a special setting mode  this mode includes pre determined settings for night shots  portraits  and landscapes speaking of controls  most controls are easy to use  remember though   it is not a point and shoot camera so expect to take some time to learn all the settings to get full use out of the camera operation of the camera was not speedy  but it wasn t a dog either  playbacks were fairly fast  when capturing  cycle time between single shots was about three seconds  power on to first shot was four to five seconds without flash  continuous drive shots were about two to three frames per second without flash  expect delays when taking multiple shots while the camera saves to the slow smartmedia memory card by the way  what s up with olympus only supplying an 8mb card  it can only hold about sixteen shots  the c 2100 s predecessor   the c 2500l   shipped with a 32mb card  get a bigger card if your going to use this camera i was disappointed that the resolution of the camera was only 2 1 megapixels  with the industry trend to create high resolution pictures for better prints  this is a step backwards  the amazing 10x zoom almost makes up for this  quot flaw quot  for those looking to get closer to the action  you can t find much better than the zoom capabilities of this camera  coupled with a 2 7x continuous digital zoom  total  27x zoom  you won t find a solution in this price range that can beat the c 2100 for me  however  superior prints are more desirable than high zoom levels actual picture quality was good  but i did notice poor color accuracy in low light situations when a flash was not used  when a flash is used  careful control needs to be used so that your subject is not washed out  image sharpness was good  the built in focus assist light allowed the camera to focus in low light with little difficulty  of course  images captured at higher iso settings were fraught with pixel noise  images captured at iso 100 were as clean as can be expected overall  i would recommend this camera to those needing exceptional zoom capabilities who are not looking to print the images at large sizes there are better alternatives for those looking for better quality images or faster cameras  these alternatives include other cameras from olympus like the e 10  4 megapixel  4x zoom  and the e 100 rs  1 5 megapixel  10x zoom  15 frames per second

523;camera;  note  update  150 5 2 03 i have updated the original  hope this review will be useful in helping you all  i have added more information such as lens flare  graininess etc  p s  i am  still  on the original bundled alkaline batteries so wow  5 stars for energy efficiency  now i have taken about a hundred high quality shots and about 20 minutes of video and frequent use of lcd for reviewing etc  flash use is moderate b first  a little rant on choosing either a70 or a60 b the powershot a60 is almost identical to the 3 mega pixel a70  physically  the only difference is a gray handgrip on the a70 while the a60 s is blue  functional differences are  640x480 movie mode for the a70  slightly faster multiple pictures shooting  about 2 6 fps vs  2 2 fps  and of course  the increase in mega pixels  so  if you do not need the extra pixels for printing 8x10 or larger pictures  the a60 will give you almost the same features as the a70  both cameras support direct print to compatible printers such as canon cp 10 and s800d   note  the a60 146s max resolution is actually adequate to produce decent 8 x 10 prints as i 146ve tried it myself you might think that since it 146s only  100 more  why not get the a70 anyway for the higher pixels  well  because if you are never going to print such large pictures  which uses a lot of ink and is expensive to print with ink jet printers  or a vga movie mode which really needs a huge compact flash card  then  you are really paying for pixels you 146ll never use  so why not use the  100 to buy an extra set of rechargeable batteries and a fast travel charger  that 146s better investment  a digicam is unlike a computer  more pixels doesn t mean future proofing  unlike pcs  where more megahertz or cpu clock speed means better future proofing  you only need as much pixels depending on the sizes of photos you ll need to print with good details   buying accessories 133   if you bought the a60  you could probably get a 128mb compactflash card  a mini usb cf card reader  and a soft case with the money saved from not getting the a70  or  you could opt for a 64mb card and a set of nimh batteries and charger  or you could use the money saved to get a set of photo ink cartridges and photo paper for your printer  of course  if you have the money to spare  then go ahead with the a70  the a60 shoots up to 1600 x 1200 and the a70 up to 2048 x 1536 pixels  i normally shoot at 1600 x 1200 which is sufficient to produce great 5 x 7 photos  and decent 8 x 10 as i 146ve experienced  this lower resolution  compared to the a70 146s max res  also allows me to take more pictures with the bundled 16 megabyte card  the camera is very comfortable to hold with a large handgrip  also part of the battery compartment  it 146s a bit tubby though and weighs around 300 grams with batteries  this means it 146s comfortable and steady in your hands but will not fit smaller pockets as easily as a sony u20  nor as portable   in the box 133   the camera comes with a 16 megabyte compact flash card  a wrist strap  software and camera manuals  two software cds  4 aa alkaline batteries  usb and video out cables  no soft case is included but i got one for free  the 16 megabyte card is too small by today 146s standards  you can only take about 16 pictures at the highest quality setting  the camera is recognized automatically by windows xp but on older systems  you will need to install the software drivers  now i 146ll get straight to what you probably want to know  how does it perform   performance   ever since getting this camera  i have taken about 3 dozen photos of various subjects ranging from kids to pets and close ups of plants and animals  i wish i can post these pictures here so you can see for yourself that this canon takes excellent quality photos  of course  you can also visit the many websites out there that feature reviews and sample pictures taken with the a60 or a70  judge for yourself but i am extremely satisfied with the quality myself  details are excellent  especially in close ups and portraits  indoor pictures with flash come out excellent as well  this is taken with the auto mode on  there are 12 shooting modes all in all  colors such as skin tones are spot on as well  startup time is about 3 seconds before you can begin shooting  shutter lag is hardly there in bright daylight or fast shutter speeds but becomes more apparent when shooting in dark indoors or at night  still  very fast response in my use my previous digicam was a first generation 0 8 mega pixel fuji and the pictures taken were too warm  i 146m really surprised at how far digicams have come today to producing the best and most accurate colors even in tricky indoor lighting conditions  i have printed out only three photos on my home canon bubble jet printer  4 x 6  and the results quite good  with my old fuji  i often had to correct and adjust the pictures before printing but with this camera  little adjustment and color correction is needed   picture softness b i have also sent off my cf card for processing at a digital color lab  fujifilm digital imaging  and the results  although a bit soft as testified by many other a70 a60 owners  look very pleasing with very good colors and decent detail level  the softness can easily be corrected through software sharpening before being printed out and even if sharpening is not done  it 146s still not that big of a deal  especially considering how many other positives the camera has going for it  i also notice that sharper digicam pictures also look grainier most times  the pictures on the a60 may not be super sharp but there is very little grain  especially at either iso 50 or iso 100  i heard the same is true for the s45 but have not seen pictures from the newer g3  i have handled the older g2 and it 146s just too bulky and heavy for my purposes but pictures are gorgeous as for  lens flare  i noticed a bit of it when shooting with the bright sun in the background or directly at it  there is also a bit of flare when shooting oncoming traffic  from headlights  at night  it isn 146t very bad compared with some other cameras i have used though  in fact  it performs better than with my samsung camera that 146s equipped with a sneichder kreuznach lens which is supposed to be specially coated to minimize lens flare b creative possibilities   one of the main reasons why i got this camera is because it offers so much creative control such as aperture priority  shutter priority  program ae and full manual control  in manual mode  you can change all exposure controls and settings  you can select shutter speeds of 15 seconds to 1 2000th of a second  aperture sizes of f2 8 to f8  different flash modes  auto focus  5 point or center focus  or manual focus  metering  center weighted  evaluative or spot  and many others  this is simply amazing and unbelievable at this price  there is even a custom white balance setting that you can set with either a white or gray card  there is no option to save your custom exposure settings though unlike the s45 which has one custom setting and the g3 which has two  no big loss  all other exposure settings remain the same after you set them as the information is stored in the camera and maintained by a small lithium battery  which also maintains date  for example if you choose shutter priority mode and set your shutter speed at 1 60  it will remain the same when you turn the camera off and then on to manual mode  there 146s also a focus assist light which is hardly found in budget digicams  very useful for shooting in the dark and also acts as the red eye reduction lamp a stitch assist mode lets you create splendid panorama shots by  147stitching 148 together multiple shots either horizontally or vertically or 360 degrees  the camera helps you align each shot by showing a bit of the previous shot on the lcd  very effective and stunning results b superb for newbies and enthusiasts alike   many who are new to digicams would probably be happy enough with the auto mode but if you are keen on learning more about photography techniques  this digicam  either a60 or a70  is the best budget choice  unlike a 35mm manual camera or slr  you don 146t have to be afraid of wasting film when experimenting with the various shooting modes and settings  i took photos of things around the house at various aperture settings and the results are great  i used a large aperture such as f2 8 to make the background blur out when taking a macro shot of a flower and a small aperture such as f8 to make everything including the background look sharp   at f8  a tripod is recommended as slow shutter speeds are sometimes needed especially when the day is cloudy or dark  if i didn 146t like any picture  i simply deleted it and started over again  no more wasted 35mm film and money wasted into developing a whole roll just to get one or two useable photos   good range of shutter speeds  another main reason why i got this camera is because of its wide range of shutter speeds  its slow speeds range up to 15 seconds  perfect for taking night scene shots  you can also choose  digital film  sensitivity from iso 50 to iso 400  anything slower than 1 3 seconds shutter speed will kick in the automatic noise reduction  for those of you who don 146t understand what this is  let me try to explain  when taking long exposure shots  noise  the stuff that makes your film look old and grainy  is almost always introduced into your pictures  this becomes much more severe at higher sensitivities such as iso 400  the camera employs an automatic noise reduction system to reduce this effect at slow shutter speeds  i took a 15 second night shot  no moon  just stars and some distant city lights  at iso 50 and the result was almost noise free  needless to say  i am much impressed   movie mode   movies are recorded with sound  in my opinion  movie modes on digicams are more like gimmicks than practical tools  they do however  provide a great way to capture small movie files for emailing to friends  especially after being edited and compressed with windows movie maker or other editing software  the camera records movies at 15 frames per second and the sound is monaural  i ve only used it twice to record small videos of the kids playing  a real amusement for the kiddies b battery life   i am still on the original bundled panasonic alkalines at the time of writing this  after taking dozens of high quality pictures with lcd on and average flash usage  i am extremely impressed by its energy efficiency  however  i recommend a set of rechargeable high capacity nimh batteries  personally  i use energizer 1700 mah batteries  overall  i have to say that battery life on this canon is simply excellent since i also used the lcd many times and for reviewing and making many manual mode settings and changes as well as connected it to my laptop for downloading b software   windows xp and mac os users will find that the camera is automatically configured for and useable without installing any of canon 146s bundled software  however  for more options and control  canon 146s zoom browser offers great versatility  i still prefer acdsee for cataloguing and browsing photo collections though  canon includes arcsoft 146s photo and video impressions software for making quick adjustments and editing of photos and videos  far from the best but adequate for newbies  i find photo impressions difficult and impractical to use with annoying button sound effects that can 146t be turned off  or i haven 146t found out how  adobe photoshop elements  a toned down version of photoshop  would have been an excellent bundled choice instead   the badside   i only have one major complaint and that is the flash does a terrible job throttling down for macro shots  macros are taken at distances as close as 5cm or 2 inches  macros at 5 cm with auto flash results in unuseable overexposed pictures  this is where the manual exposure control comes in real handy  for example  i experimented by taking a close up shot of the keys on a calculator at 5 cm  2 inches  range  on auto mode  the flash was fired and the picture was badly overexposed  so i switched to manual mode and set the shutter speed at 1 200 and aperture at f2 8 and voila  a perfect natural lighting shot  the calculator keys were perfectly exposed  all the letters were legible and clear and details extremely good  right down to the tiny scratches on the calculator surface  if you shoot at high resolutions  you can crop away certain parts of your macro shot to produce a great close up shot without loss of detail or pixilation  and as mentioned earlier  the camera 146s pictures are just a bit soft but this can be sharpened through software editing  and a small gripe  its cf card compartment cover is very flimsy  just waiting to break off  other than these  i have no other major complains   highly recommended   i highly recommend this camera  either model is good depending on your resolution needs  the camera is made in malaysia  not in japan  which probably helps to reduce its cost  it also has a plastic body  with only a metal front panel  it allows for further creativity by accepting add on macro and telephoto lenses and filters  there is also a waterproof casing available for it  no soft case is included in the box  so be sure to get one  i got one for free  the dealer threw one in for free when i complained that none was included  the case is specifically made for the a60 and a70 and is of a soft suede like material with good cushioning to protect the camera from small bumps and scratches   in conclusion 133  so what else can i say  i am very happy with my  280 purchase  you can get it for cheaper at some online stores so do shop around  it 146s a great camera and i have never enjoyed taking photos as much until now  the camera will keep both point and shooters and enthusiasts happy indeed  especially those on a budget  the softness in photos doesn 146t bother me much  it really isn 146t that bad  the photos are still very beautiful  but it might to some others  if this is the case  then you would have to move into the mid level canon s45 which does offer sharper pictures but cost a lot more  if you have lots of money to burn  and want a high quality small compact sized camera  look at the s45  nevertheless  i have no regrets getting this a60 model and buying a larger 128 mb cf card  rechargeable batteries and charger with the money saved these canon cameras come closer and closer to the prosumer  professional consumer  g2s and newer g3s  but are heavy and bulky  in terms of features  on a scale  i think the a60 and a70 are at the low budget end  while the s45 sits in the middle and the g3 at the top  the a60 and a70 cameras are a great move by canon  making many advanced manual controls available to the masses without unlimited cash  kudos to canon b this is how i would rate it b features  5 stars performance  4 stars ergonomics and build quality  4 stars battery life  5 stars value for money  5 stars this camera isn 146t perfect or doesn 146t have any flaws  but at this price  it has way more pros than cons so it rightfully earns its 5 star rating  ; note update  have updated the original hope this review will be useful in helping you all  have added more information such as lens flare graininess etc    am still on the original bundles alkaline batteries so now stars for energy efficiency now  have taken about  hundred high quality shots and about minutes of video and frequent use of led for reviewing etc flash use is moderate  first  little want on choosing either  or   the powershot  is almost identical to the meg fixed  physically the only difference is  gray handgrip on the  while the   is blue functional differences are  movie mode for the  slightly faster multiple pictures shooting about fas vs fas and of course the increase in meg pipes so if you do not need the extra pipes for printing  or larger pictures the  will give you almost the same features as the  both camera support direct print to compatible printers such as canon up and   note the   max resolution is actually adequate to produce decent  prints as  ve tried it myself you might think that since it  only more why not get the  anyway for the higher pipes well because if you are never going to print such large pictures which uses  lot of ink and is expensive to print with ink jet printers or  va movie mode which really needs  huge compact flash card then you are really paying for pipes you ll never use so why not use the to buy an extra set of rechargeable batteries and  fast travel charge that  better investment  digital is unlike  computer more pipes doesn  mean future drooping unlike pus where more megahertz or cup clock speed means better future drooping you only need as much pipes depending on the sizes of photo you ll need to print with good details buying accessories if you bought the  you could probably get  mb compactflash card  mind us cf card reader and  soft case with the money saved from not getting the  or you could opt for  mb card and  set of nigh batteries and charge or you could use the money saved to get  set of photo ink cartridges and photo paper for your printer of course if you have the money to spare then go ahead with the  the  shoots up to  and the  up to  pipes  normally shoot at  which is sufficient to produce great  photo and decent  as  ve experienced this lower resolution compared to the   max yes also allows me to take more pictures with the bundles megabyte card the camera is very comfortable to hold with  large handgrip also part of the battery compartment it   bit stubby though and weighs around grass with batteries this means it  comfortable and steady in your hands but will not fit smaller pockets as easily as  sonya  nor as portable in the box the camera comes with  megabyte compact flash card  wrist strap software and camera manual two software cos a alkaline batteries us and video out tables no

resolution needs the camera is made in malasha not in japan which probably helps to reduce its cost it also has  plastic body with only  metal front panel it allows for further creativity by accepting add on micro and telephone lenses and filters there is also  waterproof causing available for it no soft case is included in the box so be sure to get one  got one for free the dealer threw one in for free when  complained that none was included the case is specifically made for the  and  and is of  soft swede like material with good fashioning to protect the camera from small bump and scratches in conclusion so what else can  say  am very happy with my purchase you can get it for cheaper at some online stores so do shop around it   great camera and  have never enjoyed taking photo as much until now the camera will keep both point and shutters and enthusiast happy indeed especially those on  budget the softness in photo doesn  bother me much it really isn  that bad the photo are still very beautiful but it might to some others if this is the case then you would have to move into the mid level canon  which does offer sharper pictures but cost  lot more if you have lots of money to burn and want  high quality small compact sized camera look at the  nevertheless  have no regrets getting this  model and buying  larger mb cf card rechargeable batteries and charge with the money saved these canon camera come closer and closer to the presume professional consumer   and newer   but are heavy and bulky in terms of features on  scale  think the  and  are at the low budget end while the  sits in the middle and the  at the top the  and  camera are  great move by canon making many advanced manual controls available to the masses without unlimited cash buds to canon  this is how  would rate it  features stars performance stars economics and build quality stars battery life stars value for money stars this camera isn  perfect or doesn  have any flaws but at this price it has way more pro than sons so it frightfully ears its star rating

531;auto;   different or an old trend    the  147honda element 148 is not what you would call a new design  it is different yes  there 146s no arguing that  but is it in fact a new design that honda came up as an original that they could call their own  well  not quite  if you thought thoroughly about the  147honda element 146s 148 structure you would notice the fact that the  147honda element 148 is indeed an old trend coming back  about fifty sixty years ago  give or take  the primary structure of most cars was boxy  boxy frame  boxy lights if you 146re getting it  it 146s not a completely original design  why do you need to know this  well in my own opinion  i think it was a small mistake on  147honda 146s 148 part for the car they made  they created a cars image that was an image of almost all cars some years ago  but that style died  and for a reason i would guess because 133those cars weren 146t all that sharp  meaning that  147honda 148 did this just to put a car out there  they make a car that has an old trend  but they don 146t even make a single thing about the car special or unique in any way  just to clear that up  and i heard a rumor from somewhere that the honda element in fact was designed following the prints of a old milk truck 133weird b  questions that will be answered   i what is the msrp for a 4wd ex honda element  highest model i i how does the car handle i i what options are available i i what caliber of safety is this car of i i will this car last is this car a worth while investment i i is this car fit for me and my mid sized family i b  handling   handling is what you would expect of a car of this size  i turned  stopped  went and parked  truly i couldn 146t find anything special than that of the honda civic  the only thing that did shine was the four wheel drive  it started better and it seemed to pull itself up hills effortlessly  also  i have lived in numerous states of varying climates on the east coast  and i can tell you by personal experience  it is a good thing to own a 4 wheel drive car when a blizzard rolls in  specifically pennsylvania  however the handling is not quite affected by the 4 wheel drive as much as you would think  you do not stop better  turning is not affected to a point you could notice and the car doesn 146t park tighter or is easier to maneuver  of course  4 wheel drive doesn 146t make you godlike so if you don 146t need 4 wheel drive  save some cash and go a different direction driving the  147honda element 148 is like a mix from driving something as a go kart  extremely maneuverable  and very easy to control and responsive  or a hummer  bulky  heavy  not as responsive  or something that can start and stop as quick  so in the middle would be the honda element  excellent starting  good stopping  good turning  great parking  fairly maneuverable and quite responsive handling is what makes this car a worthwhile burden to let a good 20 000 dollars out your pocket  great in all categories  and starts very well if you are purchasing the 4 wheel drive ex dx b  the interior comfort and the others   i must say  it is a beautiful interior  especially with black leather seats and a silver dash board  it 146s a very modernized interior and i greatly approved of it  the dashboard  the instrument panels and gauges were placed very well  if anything i would praise honda for their work on the interior of the honda element  and if you pick the ex with the proper accessories and options  the element 146s interior is a thing of beauty  except the flaw of comfort 133 i comfort   well  just because it 146s nice looking  doesn 146t mean it has to be comfortable  and in this case  it couldn 146t be anymore true  after a few minutes of sitting in the driver 146s seat  the seat that should be made with the most comfort since the driver is the driver  my butt was friggin 146 soar  i would shift from side to side to help  but the seats are just way to stiff whether i was spoiled from more comfortable leather seats i don 146t know  all i know is the honda elements seats could have been more comfortable  and definitely would have been better if they actually were more comfortable  i can 146t find a huge difference with the fabric and leather  but i think i can feel the fabric absorb slightly more therefore being softer  and more comfortable i others   well  there are some attractive catches that come with the honda element  such as the complete folding seats  front and back  why you would ever want to fold all the seats down i don 146t know  but it 146s cool right because it 146s there and you can go ahead and do it for fun and then there is the folding out doors  a new thing honda has done  which open out in opposite ways  what does this do  it does 133nothing  it might save some space of clearance between the front and back seats  and it allows you to open the entire car for yourself if you were planning to vacuum it  or have it inspected  whatever you want b engine mileage  i fought myself wondering whether or not i should mention the engines power  because if you were even interested in purchasing this car the last thing you would have considered would be the engine  but hey  it would be nice for you to have a vague peek at what the honda element 146s engine can provide so 133it 146s your average sized 6 cylinder engine  maybe a little smaller than a normal 6 cylinder engine because it is 2 4 liters  displacement  and i was surprised to find out the honda element was not a weak engine  it just wasn 146t special with it 146s fair torque and 160 horse engine  from looks alone you would think a car such as the honda element would be a weak sedan  but 133it 146s not  checking my mileage with the honda element  i was getting a good 30 35miles per gallon  you can consider this good  since i drove about in the city with a lot of stop go traffic  also to mention  this car is four wheel drive  getting the two wheel drive model would raise you gas mileage considerably  but don 146t forget you 146ll be sacrificing control for distance well the car is fair for it 146s gas mileage  but in the end it 146s just good  because the car is most definitely not fuel conservative  or have a hybrid 4 cylinder engine  so don 146t expect to be amazed  you 146ll get best performance with this car if you live possibly in the country  flat land  don 146t have to much uneven land to navigate  or forced stops  traffic lights  intersections b  safety   safety is an extremely important factor in a car  especially one on the nimble side  i am glad to say that the honda element is fairly safe  with no awards  or 4 star awards  considering the way it was created if you notice the passenger driver side doors  you 146ll see that they open out with no reinforcements  it can make someone to wonder what a side impact would do to the car people inside  well the car 146s doors are in fact very secure  when you close the doors steel beams inside the doors lock together  go ahead and try to nudge them open or try and pull to make them sway  hondas employees will let you do as you please if you feel the need to prove something to yourself  and you are willing to buy it if you break it then there are some safety features that are most definitely found in all cars of good quality  such as the four wheel anti lock abs brakes  and brake turning assists  all so vague that you would never know it was there unless someone was to take it away  in my opinion  all good cars have this  and honda has made a good car that is safe enough to sustain damage  while being versatile enough to never have to be in that situation   by the way  don 146t be cheap  get the front side airbags and all that i mentioned  since all of it is an added safety option i  options      4wd automatic transmission front side airbags  nighthawk black pearl exterior  side steps  door visor  sunroof  security system  fog lamps  wear tough floor mats  burnt black leather seats  black interior  powered windows  am fm and cd player  air conditioning   147most of the things mentioned were completely optional  while others were your average package that would come with the car 148  these are not my options  but the options of the car i test drove to see what the element was all about msrp    22 138  not bad for a car that seats four b  wrap up   to make it simple  there is always some specific part of a car or trait that makes it stand out  a hummer is big  a yugo is crappy  and a mini is small and fuel efficient  as far as the honda element goes  the master trait would be cargo space  for such a small car  the cargo space is unbeatable  it is just about as big as any suv trunk  and definitely bigger than any suv trunk that has a third row of seats hogging room so there you have it  the honda element  an amazingly average car  made by the people at honda who were trying to think outside the box 133but all they did was make a box i hope you enjoyed this review  and that it will be useful to you at sometime place  ; different or an old trend the hand element is not what you would call  new design it is different yes there  no arguing that but is it in fact  new design that hand came up as an original that they could call their own well not quite if you thought thoroughly about the hand element  structure you would notice the fact that the hand element is indeed an old trend coming back about fifty sixty years ago give or take the primary structure of most cars was body body frame body lights if you re getting it it  not  completely original design why do you need to know this well in my own opinion  think it was  small mistake on hand  part for the car they made they created  cars image that was an image of almost all cars some years ago but that style died and for  reason  would guess because those cars weren  all that sharp meaning that hand did this just to put  car out there they make  car that has an old trend but they don  even make  single thing about the car special or unique in any way just to clear that up and  heard  rumor from somewhere that the hand element in fact was designed following the prints of  old milk truck weird  questions that will be answered  what is the more for  we ex hand element highest model   how does the car handle   what option are available   what calibre of safety is this car of   will this car last is this car  worth while investment   is this car fit for me and my mid sized family   handling handling is what you would expect of  car of this size  turned stopped went and marked truly  couldn  find anything special than that of the hand civic the only thing that did shine was the four wheel drive it started better and it seemed to pull itself up hills effortlessly also  have lived in numerous states of varying climate on the east coast and  can tell you by personal experience it is  good thing to own  wheel drive car when  blizzard rolls in specifically pennsylvania however the handling is not quite affected by the wheel drive as much as you would think you do not stop better turning is not affected to  point you could notice and the car doesn  park tighter or is easier to maneuver of course wheel drive doesn  make you godlike so if you don  need wheel drive save some cash and go  different direction driving the hand element is like  mix from driving something as  go part extremely maneuverable and very easy to control and responsive or  summer bulky heavy not as responsive or something that can start and stop as quick so in the middle would be the hand element excellent starting good stopping good turning great parking fairly maneuverable and quite responsive handling is what makes this car  worthwhile burden to let  good dollars out your pocket great in all categories and starts very well if you are purchasing the wheel drive ex do  the interior comfort and the others  must say it is  beautiful interior especially with black leather seats and  silver dash board it   very modernized interior and  greatly approved of it the dashboard the instrument panel and gauge were placed very well if anything  would praise hand for their work on the interior of the hand element and if you pick the ex with the proper accessories and option the element  interior is  thing of beauty except the flaw of comfort  comfort well just because it  nice looking doesn  mean it has to be comfortable and in this case it couldn  be anymore true after  few minutes of sitting in the driver  seat the seat that should be made with the most comfort since the driver is the driver my butt was origin soar  would shift from side to side to help but the seats are just way to stiff whether  was spoiled from more comfortable leather seats  don  know all  know is the hand elements seats could have been more comfortable and definitely would have been better if they actually were more comfortable  can  find  huge difference with the fabric and leather but  think  can feel the fabric absorb slightly more therefore being softer and more comfortable  others well there are some attractive catches that come with the hand element such as the complete folding seats front and back why you would ever want to fold all the seats down  don  know but it  cool right because it  there and you can go ahead and do it for fun and then there is the folding out doors  new thing hand has done which open out in opposite ways what does this do it does nothing it might save some space of clearance between the front and back seats and it allows you to open the entire car for yourself if you were planning to vacuum it or have it inspected whatever you want  engine mileage  fought myself wondering whether or not  should mention the engines power because if you were even interested in purchasing this car the last thing you would have considered would be the engine but hey it would be nice for you to have  vague week at what the hand element  engine can provide so it  your average sized cylinder engine maybe  little smaller than  normal cylinder engine because it is liners displacement and  was surprised to find out the hand element was not  weak engine it just wasn  special with it  fair true and horse engine from looks alone you would think  car such as the hand element would be  weak sedan but it  not checking my mileage with the hand element  was getting  good miles per gallon you can consider this good since  drove about in the city with  lot of stop go traffic also to mention this car is four wheel drive getting the two wheel drive model would raise you gas mileage considerably but don  forget you ll be sacrificing control for distance well the car is fair for it  gas mileage but in the end it  just good because the car is most definitely not fuel conservative or have  horrid cylinder engine so don  expect to be amazed you ll get best performance with this car if you live possibly in the country flat land don  have to much uneven land to navigable or forced stops traffic lights intersecting  safety safety is an extremely important factor in  car especially one on the nimble side  am glad to say that the hand element is fairly safe with no awards or star awards considering the way it was created if you notice the passenger driver side doors you ll see that they open out with no reinforcements it can make someone to wonder what  side impact would do to the car people inside well the car  doors are in fact very secure when you close the doors steel beams inside the doors lock together go ahead and try to judge them open or try and pull to make them sway hands employees will let you do as you please if you feel the need to prove something to yourself and you are willing to buy it if you break it then there are some safety features that are most definitely found in all cars of good quality such as the four wheel anti lock as rakes and brake turning assist all so vague that you would never know it was there unless someone was to take it away in my opinion all good cars have this and hand has made  good car that is safe enough to sustain damage while being versatile enough to never have to be in that situation by the way don  be cheap get the front side airbags and all that  mentioned since all of it is an added safety option  option we automatic transmission front side airbags nighthawk black pearl exterior side steps door vigor sunroof security system fog lamps wear tough floor mats burnt black leather seats black interior lowered windows am am and d player air conditioning most of the things mentioned were completely optional while others were your average package that would come with the car these are not my option but the option of the car  test drove to see what the element was all about more not bad for  car that seats four  wrap up to make it simple there is always some specific part of  car or trait that makes it stand out  summer is big  hugo is happy and  mind is small and fuel efficient as far as the hand element goes the master trait would be cargo space for such  small car the cargo space is unbearable it is just about as big as any sun trunk and definitely bigger than any sun trunk that has  third row of seats hugging room so there you have it the hand element an amazingly average car made by the people at hand who were trying to think outside the box but all they did was make  box  hope you enjoyed this review and that it will be useful to you at sometime place

534;camera; first of all  let me say i had never even held a digital camera until my ricoh rdc 6000 arrived at 3 00 pm one afternoon  by 4 30 pm i was emailing pictures of the cats to my husband at work  within 24 hours i had 70 pictures of vacation bible school up on the internet for the parents to see  it just doesn t get much easier than this  now  let me back up a little  when i first opened the box and saw all the cables and books  i thought   i can t wait for my husband to get home to figure this out  as i started handling the camera and looking at the literature  i thought  well  at least i can get the battery charged before ted gets home  can you see where this is going  instead of trying to figure out everything at once i just kept solving little  how to  problems and the next thing you know  i had taken a picture of the box the camera came in the ricoh rdc 6000 can be overwhelming when you first open the box  there is so much more than just a camera in there  in addition to the camera i found cable for usb connection cable for serial connection cable for television connection ac adapter power cord for ac adapter rechargeable battery 8 mb smartmedia memory card converter cable for round serial port  i think that s what it is camera case camera strap operation manual software manual battery manual  the battery has its own manual software cd for windows software cd for macs registration questionnaire technical service document a packet of offers and advertisements fifteen minutes after opening the box i had all these parts and manuals and documents spread out on my kitchen table  i attached the strap  inserted the battery  and plugged in the ac adapter  since i could turn the camera on now and i did not have to wait until the battery was fully charged  i thought i d take a few pictures  a quick glance at the operation manual  i found the large dial on the top of the camera  turned it to picture taking mode and snapped away  another check of the manual  i turned the dial to playback mode  and scrolled through the pictures i had just taken  there was no stopping me now  i turned that dial one more time to delete mode and started over  after a few minutes of this i wanted to email the pictures to my husband so i got the software manual and the windows cd  following the very simple instructions i installed the usb driver  the ricoh camera utility and a photo editing software called arcsoft  i attached the usp cable to the computer and the camera  turned that large dial on top of the camera to pc mode  opened the ricoh utility and followed the directions  i now had  jpg files on my hard drive  just treat these as you would any other  jpg file  you can use photo editing software to edit them  attach them to email  upload them to various photo storing websites  whatever you fancy  since i wanted to take pictures of vacation bible school the next day  it was now time to figure out more of the bells and whistles of this camera  since many of you will find all the details boring  or even incomprehensible  they are at the end of this review and can safely be skipped without losing the sense of this epinion b what i really like about this camera  using the 8 mb smartmedia card that the camera comes with and setting it to 640 x 480 normal  i can take 99 pictures and the quality is good enough to get 4  x 6  prints  the camera takes smartmedia cards up to 64 mb and in 640 x 480 economy that would be 1 690 pictures   on one card   but probably only good for wallet sized prints  it is also possible to set this camera to take pictures at 2000 x 1480 pixels  in this case  you d get 5 pictures on an 8 mb smartmedia card or 43 pictures on a 64 mb smartmedia card and could probably get a good print at 10  x 13  anyway you look at it  this was more pictures than i expected to be able to get on one smartmedia card the ricoh rdc 6000 is pocket sized at 4   x 2   x 1   it really isn t much bigger than my kodak advantix or any 35 mm camera i have owned the camera has many bells and whistles that i have yet to master including redeye reduction  playback to a tv  white balance  manual focus and focus lock  monochrome mode  protect from erasure  setting aperture priority  instead of automatic  changing iso sensitivity  interval shooting  and using an optional remote control unit  i am most definitely an amateur photographer and anything that can be set to  automatic  is set to  automatic  so much of these extras will go unused by me much of the camera is intuitive  i managed to set the date and time without ever looking at the manual  the menus on the lcd monitor are logical and easy to follow  i was up and running in just over an hour  and i had a problem installing the software that had nothing to do with ricoh that took me 30 minutes to fix the outdoor shots came out incredible  that may have something to do with the sun  the blue skies  and the total lack of clouds we have here in lubbock  but i got one picture of balloons floating in the sky that shows so much detail i can hardly believe i took it b what i don t like about this camera  the operation manual was translated from japanese  page 19 instructs you to charge the batteries  plural  before loading but on page 27  it is obvious you have to load the battery  there is only one  in order to charge it the slot for the smartmedia card has a cover that cannot be opened with your fingernail  i need a knife or nail file to get this opened  maybe it needs to be broken in but right now it is tough to open the flash cannot be used while taking motion pictures the camera case that comes with this camera holds only the camera and a smartmedia card  there is no place to store the battery in this camera case and the manual recommends removing the battery to store the camera   what i haven t decided on yet  i took 40 pictures indoors with a flash before i needed to recharge the battery  in that time i played back all of them to check for quality and deleted about 5 pictures  after the 40 pictures  i became tethered to an outlet to finish taking pictures that morning  for most projects  that s probably enough charge to take a sufficient number of pictures  but i guess i was excited about my new camera and went crazy taking pictures b most of the important details  can be safely skipped unless you are serious about buying this camera the large dial on the top has a total of six modes set mode   let s you format the smartmedia card  set the date or language  and various other functions of the camera movie mode   allows you to take short movie pictures as avi files still mode   allows you to take snap shots review mode   allows you to see the movies or pictures you have taken delete mode   can erase one or more of the files on the camera pc mode   for transferring files to the pc also on top of the camera are three buttons for flash  timer  and image quality and a small lcd panel  the flash can be always on  always off  automatic  or slow synchronized for indoor use  the self timer allows for a 10 second delay between pressing the shutter release button and actually taking the picture  there are nine image quality settings ranging from 1600 x 1200 fine to 640 x 480 economy  the lcd panel has readouts on flash mode  self timer  picture quality  battery power  redeye reduction  and recording mode  still or movie in addition to the power button  the back of the camera has six other buttons and an lcd monitor  two buttons with up and down arrows let you scroll through the menus and the files  pictures  and allow you to zoom in from 1x to 2x to 3x to 4x  the display button changes the lcd monitor display turning it off and on  to save batteries while the camera stays on  or changes the display from one picture to six pictures  the cancel  enter and menu buttons are used with the various menus in the various modes and are really self explanatory once you are in a certain mode  the lcd monitor is where you find all the important information like date  time  number of pictures on the smartmedia card  approximate number of pictures left to take  zoom level  flash mode  and focus mode the bottom of the camera had a tripod screw hole and a dial to adjust the brightness on the lcd monitor b results and recommendations  i have uploaded pictures from the camera to my computer to a photo hosting web site and they really are very good  i am no great photographer but the parents of the kids at vacation bible school were impressed  total time from camera to web site was about 20 minutes  later  i went back to my files and edited about 20 of the pictures that were too dark or too light  using microsoft photo editor software  and uploaded the new pictures to the web site  that took about 20 minutes for editing and uploading  i took a few pictures in each of the zoom modes  1x through 4x  and they seem to be as good as any other picture i took  i printed a few pictures  640 x 480 normal quality  at about 5  x 7  on regular  not photo  paper and they are acceptable  they are group shots and people are recognizable  the recommended maximum size for this quality is 4  x 6 i have taken one motion picture  uploaded the avi file  and viewed it just to see how it worked  it was quite simple  press the shutter release to start recording  press it again to stop  upload using the same ricoh utility that is used for stills  so far  i have taken advantage of one offer that came with the camera  i joined photoisland com and have received 75 mb of storage for pictures  i have not yet uploaded any pictures to them but 75 mb of storage will go a long way with only an 8 mb smartmedia card  that s close to 900 pictures i could store on their site if you are new to digital cameras and would rather not start at the low end with a limited camera  i highly recommend the ricoh rdc 6000  it is easy to use  most functions can be set to an automatic mode  and yet it is still capable of taking some very high quality pictures and videos  as you become a more advanced photographer  you can use more of the manual modes to take exactly the picture you want  and don t be overwhelmed by all the parts  cables  and papers that come in the box  it is very easy to sort out what exactly you need  ; first of all let me say  had never even held  digital camera until my rich rd arrived at pm one afternoon by pm  was smiling pictures of the cats to my husband at work within hours  had pictures of vacation bible school up on the internet for the parents to see

camera and would rather not start at the low end with  limited camera  highly recommend the rich rd it is easy to use most functions can be set to an automatic mode and yet it is still capable of taking some very high quality pictures and video as you become  more advanced photographer you can use more of the manual modes to take exactly the picture you want and don  be overwhelmed by all the parts tables and papers that come in the box it is very easy to sort out what exactly you need

541;auto; i bought the 2001 integra gs coupe  at  back in january 2001  6 months before it is replaced by the all new rsx  it 146s the last of its generation  first of all  i have to admit that i should have waited for 6 more months and get an all new rsx at about same price or got a mt gsr type r  nonetheless  i enjoy the ride of this car since it is my first purchased vehicle and didn 146t drive much before  i didn 146t do much research on different models vendors  i did consider toyota celica  mitsubishi eclipse  honda accord coupe  i didn 146t look at european vendor because my budget was just slightly more than  20k  plus i don 146t believe reliability on european cars  except mercedez benz  celica and eclipse were ruled out because of awkward styling and reliability respective while accord coupe is too  roomy  and too sedan style  the only sporty car left in my list was the legendary integra  and given the reliability rating of honda acura  it was the best choice exterior i love the styling  even better than the new rsx  it 146s has a traditional japanese hot rod  sporty styling  but without over aggressive as eclipse and celica   of course  integra can have very aggressive exterior after all those after market body kits  its smooth front end  with 4 round headlights gives an  intelligent  outlook  which is well received by young professionals  though this exterior has been for integra since 94  which was amazing back then  it still looks good nowadays  i won 146t say the styling is out dated  but rather a bit boring since there are so many integras out there on the street  after 8 years in production interior in general  i think the interior is what bring down the rating of this car  there is not much upgrade  except from cassette to cd player  since the 3rd generation of integra came out in 94  it may be cool looking back then  but it 146s out dated after 8 years  the console is comparable to the accord 2 generations back  the cd player is kind of hard to reach from driver seat and you need to lean a bit forward to reach the cd player  the dash board looks good though not excited  it 146s easy to read during day time even under bright sunlight  at night it looks ok as well don 146t see any reflection from the windshield  thanks to the dash broad is mounted kind of deep inside the console engine integra ls gs comes with 1 8l 140hp 6400rpm and 125lb ft 4200rpm  red zone is at around 6800rpm  non vtec  it provides just enough power for daily drive  as i said  i should have bought a gsr or type r which provides 170 and 195hp respectively with around  2k 3k more  one may ask why not get a muscle car like mustang with cheaper price but higher hp  personally  i admire the way japanese and german built engines  probably due to many racing events in those countries have placed limitations on engine size  japanese and german automakers have traditions to build efficient and sophisticated engines  they can boost the engine to produce 100 hp on each liter  eg  s2000  integra type r  m3  and even the enzo  honestly  i don 146t know how much technology ford has put in the mustang engine in which only produce 190hp from 3 8l and 320hp from 4 6l handling since my car is automatic transmission  i can 146t say much about handling  however  some sharp corning has been quite stable and responsive on integra  not sure if it is because i install the front strut bar  the same oem one installed on gsr  compare with rsx  test drive  apparently  integra showed better stability on cornering  on rsx  in order to save space in front  the engine is mounted reversely and more towards the bumper  the result shifts the weight towards front of the front axles and this causes the more under steering  road holding is very good on integra  thanks to 4 independent double wishbone suspensions acceleration acceleration is something really kills an at integra  i don 146t have a real figure on my integra for 0 60mph  but most figures on the web showing around 10secs  a result of non vtec and 4 gears  instead of 5 on mt  the engine is especially hard to pick up the speed in 2nd and 3rd gears braking integra equips with 4 disc brakes and abs with 4 wheel speed sensors  because the car is lighter than average sedan  the brake is quite responsive suspension integra equipped with 4 independent double wishbone suspension which offers excellent response and handling  i also installed front strut bar from acura  the same one comes with gsr models  driver can really feel the road  but provide reasonably comfort  which makes it fun to drive on local or highway  i would say the suspension is sporty but not harsh roominess well  as a coupe  we can 146t expect much on roominess  there is not much space in fact for passengers  the driver seat is most suitable for 5 14610 146 146 people with average size  for me  i have to push the driver seat all the way back so that my leg won 146t hit the steering wheel when pressing the brake pedal  even after i set the steering wheel to its highest position  thus the passenger seat behind is basically useless  the trunk is large enough to put 1 mid size and 1 large luggage  but can accommodate more when folder down on passenger seats tires the original tires comes with my integra are michelin xgt v4  ultra performance  most people don 146t have a good review on these tires though  so far it is ok with me  and i don 146t think i haven 146t pushed them to the limit yet equipments as expected from most honda vehicles  it provided most equipments as standard  which is good for me as a first time buyer  the integra gs comes with standard leather trim  moonroof  cd player  6 speakers  immobilizer  alloy wheels  leather steering wheel  power windows  and power locks headlights though the 4 round front headlights provide distinctive look  it does not provide adequate brightness on near ground  the focus seems to be on distance objects but not on foreground near the car  sometimes i don 146t see a bump till 15 20 feet away  that 146s why i installed fog light to compensate this  as well as for cool looking  i used piaa extreme whites and piaa super plasma for low beams and fog lights respectively  which are much better than average halogen bulbs safety only front driver and passenger airbags are provided which provide average protection  2000 and 2001 integras have installed 2 strong steel side impact beams on each front door to protect passenger from fatal injury  4 disc brakes with abs provide reasonably active safety reliability after driving the car for 2 5 years  i don 146t see any major mechanical problem at all on my integra  here is the list of problem i encountered so far 1  key got locked in steering column  it turns out to be my 3rd party security system has screwed up the circuit  not the problem from my car  acura dealer was very helpful to diagnose the problem for me 2  passenger seat is a bit out of the track  this got fixed with any charge  under warranty acura provides 4 year warranty which is better than average japanese made automobiles insurance prepare to live with high premium on integra  from statistics  integra appeals theft seven times more than average sedans  partly due to its high resell value and popularity  and also because most of its mechanical components can be used on civic without much modification   we all know that civic has been a popular modification target for street rocket and that create a huge demand on integra components in conclusion  i enjoy and love my integra very much  my only complaint is the horsepower  as i said  i should have bought the gsr  170hp  or even type r  195hp  if you are looking for a used fun car to drive with reliability  i would definitely recommend integra  ;  bought the integral is couple at back in january months before it is replaced by the all new is it  the last of its generation first of all  have to admit that  should have waited for more months and get an all new is at about same price or got  mt gr type  nonetheless  enjoy the ride of this car since it is my first purchased vehicle and didn  drive much before  didn  do much research on different models vendor  did consider tooth relics mitsubishi ellipse hand accord couple  didn  look at european vendor because my budget was just slightly more than  plus  don  believe reliability on european cars except mercedez bent relics and ellipse were ruled out because of awkward saying and reliability respective while accord couple is too room and too sedan style the only sport car left in my list was the legendary integral and given the reliability rating of hand acute it was the best choice exterior  love the saying even better than the new is it  has  traditional japanese hot rod sport saying but without over aggressive as ellipse and relics of course integral can have very aggressive exterior after all those after market body kits its smooth front end with round headlights gives an intelligent outlook which is well received by young professional though this exterior has been for integral since which was amazing back then it still looks good nowadays  won  say the saying is out dated but rather  bit boring since there are so many integral out there on the street after years in production interior in general  think the interior is what bring down the rating of this car there is not much upgrade except from cassette to d player since the rd generation of integral came out in it may be cool looking back then but it  out dated after years the console is comparable to the accord generations back the d player is kind of hard to reach from driver seat and you need to lean  bit forward to reach the d player the dash board looks good though not excited it  easy to read during day time even under bright sunlight at night it looks ok as well don  see any reflection from the windshield thanks to the dash broad is mounted kind of deep inside the console engine integral is is comes with  he rum and lb ft rum red zone is at around rum non ten it provides just enough power for daily drive as  said  should have bought  gr or type  which provides and he respectively with around   more one may ask why not get  muscle car like mustn with cheaper price but higher he personally  admire the way japanese and german built engines probably due to many racing events in those countries have placed limitations on engine size japanese and german automakers have traditions to build efficient and sophisticated engines they can boost the engine to produce he on each later eg  integral type   and even the endo honestly  don  know how much technology ford has put in the mustn engine in which only produce he from  and he from  handling since my car is automatic transmission  can  say much about handling however some sharp morning has been quite stable and responsive on integral not sure if it is because  install the front strut bar the same dem one installed on gr compare with is test drive apparently integral showed better stability on covering on is in order to save space in front the engine is mounted severely and more towards the jumper the result shifts the weight towards front of the front axles and this causes the more under sneering road holding is very good on integral thanks to independent double wishbone suspensions acceleration acceleration is something really kills an at integral  don  have  real figure on my integral for may but most figures on the web showing around seas  result of non ten and years instead of on mt the engine is especially hard to pick up the speed in nd and rd years breaking integral equip with disc rakes and as with wheel speed sensory because the car is lighter than average sedan the brake is quite responsive suspension integral equipped with independent double wishbone suspension which offers excellent response and handling  also installed front strut bar from acute the same one comes with gr models driver can really feel the road but provide reasonably comfort which makes it fun to drive on local or highway  would say the suspension is sport but not harsh roominess well as  couple we can  expect much on roominess there is not much space in fact for passengers the driver seat is most suitable for people with average size for me  have to push the driver seat all the way back so that my leg won  hit the sneering wheel when pressing the brake pedal even after  set the sneering wheel to its highest position thus the passenger seat behind is basically useless the trunk is large enough to put mid size and large luggage but can accommodate more when older down on passenger seats tires the original tires comes with my integral are michel it

content 44580114052 smartmedia memory card a a usb cable cd with software and drivers instruction manual  software guide and registration     my test results  b b movies  the movies are rather small but remember this camera is a still photo camera so the movies are an extra feature added  the 320 x 240 hq mode is rather small on the computer but it produces a nice 15 second movie without any sound  the 160 x 120 sq mode is too small for me but it produces a longer movie of about 60 seconds and seems clearer because of the smaller size  movie shots need to be taken in well lighted areas b photo color  the photo color is great especially in outdoor shots and well lighted indoor shots b sharpness  the photos seem to have pretty good clarity but when closely looking around the corners they seem to get a little distorted  printing up the photo on a 4 x 6 inches print produced a flawless photo  printing the same photo on an 8 x 10 showed a slight distortion but it is hardly noticeable unless you look for it b night shots  the night shots outside are pretty good as long as the subject isn 146t too far away and that there is some decent lighting around  the night shots do tend to produce a little more noticeable grain than the day time shots b outdoor shots  about the best of all the shots taken  bright and colorful  in some instances the sun may be too bright  then you need to compensate with the exposure compensation to get your best results  using the flash outdoors in the auto mode also helps in producing great photos that are up close b flash shots  the flash is alright  it just isn 146t made for any distance shots  under most flash shots within about 10 feet the photos turned out rather well  incandescent lighting is tough sometimes and i find the setting the camera on the incandescent whit balance setting helps  you may have to experiment with settings to get your best results b batteries  i was using the ni mh rechargeable batteries and did take 150 shots before recharging and it still had power to shoot a few more b use  the olympus d 380 is about as easy as it comes to using and setting up to use with your computer  you can make some minor adjustments to get the camera to your preference but then it is basically just point at the subject  hold the shutter button down half way for the camera to auto focus for you and then push the button all the way down to snap the photo  the software and driver loaded without any problems on my computer using windows me and uploading the photos to the computer are automatic once i connect the usb cable to the camera and computer b  overall  b this is a camera that a lot of people will enjoy for the price  ease of use and photo quality this is a great camera for the first timer or the person on a budget wanting a good quality digital camera i do recommend buying the ni mh rechargeable batteries and a 64mb or 128mb smartmedia card b thank you for reading my review    b  print your

544;camera; i was never that interested in getting a digital camera  yeah  i thought they looked nice and the concept was good  they were always too expensive though  for my birthday this year my girlfriend epinionid mookasaurs  bought me the kodak millenium edition camera the millenium package came with an 8 mb picture card and a usb removable disk  the 8 mb card will hold about 26 pictures with this camera  very similar to the 25 pictures i was accustomed too with my advantix  i wasn t quite content with that  when i go places i usually bring a couple rolls of film  for use around the house 8 mb is plenty  i can take 26 pictures  load them on my hard drive and go for another round  if i m away though i can do that  i was able to acquire a 32 mb picture card and now i have plenty of storage for my pictures  this card will hold 113 pictures at the highest resolution and over 250 at the lowest  i ve even heard that there is a 196 mb picture card out  that s just amazing the removable disk is very convenient  it looks like a little mouse  it connects into a usb port in your computer and you can slide your picture disk into the slot  this is much more convenient than hooking the camera up to the computer every time you want to read the disk  the setup for this was really easy and i was so close to being able to do it without the directions  of course my mom always says  people get paid good money to write those directions enough about the gizmos and gadgets  i m sure you want to know about the camera  the camera is extremely easy to use  i still haven t had to crack open the instruction booklet yet  it only takes a few minutes to set the time  date and any other settings like resolution  put the picture card in and you re ready to go  for those who are use to a regular camera you ll notice that the digital camera is much heavier  part of this is because of the 4 aa batteries required to operate the camera  flip the power on  set the camera to capture mode  aim and shoot  the picture will then come up on the lcd screen on the back of the camera  you have the option to delete it if you want  i suggest you don t delete pictures till you need the space  even bad pictures are nice to look at later on in life  you can always download them to your computer and not have to worry about them taking space on your picture card  you can also set the camera to review mode and look at all of the pictures you have taken so far  you re allowed to delete pictures in this mode also the camera has three different flash modes  on  off and red eye reduction  the flash is extremely bright so don t look directly into the light  there is also a timer on the camera so you can set it down and get into the picture yourself  the zoom lens on the camera is a very nice feature to take close ups  there are a couple of downsides to the digital camera  with regular cameras you can take pictures one after the other  the digital camera has like a 10 second pause where it is writing the picture to the disk  this can cause you to miss some good pictures  it also chews up batteries at a good rate  i ve gone through a set of batteries already in just three weeks  the only other problem i can see is the inconvenience of having to get pictures developed  all of the options there are to get them developed seem really expensive overall i suggest investing in one of these cameras  you can email all your pictures to friends and family  put them on your web site or just keep them on your computer for your personal viewing br br  ;

547;camera; i ve been doing photography for 25 years  mostly with 35mm slrs  i own 2 nikon f2 cameras and 8 nikkor lenses  and have always been a  nikon man  this company has products which  in my opinion  are far superior to all but the most expensive  german made  cameras  and in any event nikon cameras are unequaled in durability and flexibility  next time you see a newspaper photographer  you will probably notice he she is using nikon equipment  that s no accident  nikons stand up to abuse better than anything else i bought the cp5000  first  for the 5 megapixel feature  as a long time user of nikkor lenses  i am used to outstanding image quality  and i demand it in my photography  i have found that this camera delivers it  when i use it within its limitations  more on that later  also  as i mentioned  the nikon name means quality to me  and i haven t been disappointed with the 5000 the first thing i noticed when i anxiously opened the box for the first time is that this camera is tiny  almost too small for my liking  as i am a big guy with big hands  but i got used to it  moreover  as i am used to the heavy  all mechanical f2  it was disconcerting to take a picture and not hear and feel that shutter cycle and the mirror slam home  but this  too  i got used to  an f2 with motor drive and battery pack can weigh close to 5 pounds  depending on the lens used  this is definately no f2 the technology that went into this camera is nothing short of amazing  i cannot believe the things it can do  and the flexibility of modes of operation is impressive  in this respect  this camera is every bit a nikon  a lot of the features are probably availiable on other digital cameras in the same price range  but i was used to a mechanical camera  so i was impressed the lens is excellent  although i am somewhat disappointed with the edge sharpness in extreme close ups  please keep in mind  however  that i am used to using high end  professional quality lenses  the flexibility of the cp5000 lens is such that it cannot do everything equally well  the very fact that this is a 3x wide to tele zoom  that can focus to 3 4  is amazing  it is unfair to compare it with my 55mm f 3 5 micro nikkor  while center sharpness is outstanding  if you intend to do a lot of extreme close ups  don t expect it to perform like a dedicated close up lens some things that i like  the incredible image quality  and i am a very demanding user in that respect  the 8x10 prints i produce with this camera get a lot of comments like  that s a digital camera  wow  in spite of my initial reservations about the small size  i can put it in my pocket and take candids of my drunk friends at the bar  i can t do that with an f2  the abundant features  like multi mode auto exposure  white balance preset  you set the white balance by reading a white card  which makes it possible to have a perfect setting in any light conditions  very cool  also  manual focus override is useful for extreme close ups  this camera does more stuff than 95  of users will ever need  but whatever your requirements  you will find features that make you say  wow  that s cool  this camera has a solid feel  the body is made of magnesium  and in spite of it s tiny size  it has a nice heft  you can tell it s not a plastic camera  the swiveling lcd screen is great for shooting at waist level  or other strange positions  great for candid photography some complaints  the flash sensor is placed in just about the worst spot imagineable for someone with big hands  it s easy to get used to if you use the camera regularly  but if i hand it to someone else i have to warn them to keep their fingers out of the way    the autofocus is slow  so if you pick up the camera and try to  grab  a quick shot  you sometimes miss it while the camera focuses  if you prefocus the camera by half pressing the shutter button  however  there is almost no shutter lag at all  this is a lot better than other digital cameras  this point deserves some discussion  i notice that many reviews say that this camera has no shutter lag at all  while others say thet the lag is unacceptable  this camera does not have shutter lag   it has autofocus lag  there is new firmware  that i have not installed yet  that is supposed to improve autofocus performance  i hope it helps that s about all  it is a fact that no matter what camera you buy  something better will be availiable in a few months that will be better  and the one you bought will be availiable for a couple of hundred dollars less  overall  i m happy with the cp5000  the quality and features are worth the money  ;  ve been doing photography for years mostly with mm sir  own union  camera and nikkor lenses and have always been  union man this company has products which in my opinion are far superior to all but the most expensive german made camera and in any event union camera are unequaled in disability and flexibility next time you see  newspaper photographer you will probably notice he she is using union equipment that  no accident unions stand up to abuse better than anything else  bought the up first for the megapixel feature as  long time user of nikkor lenses  am used to outstanding image quality and  demand it in my photography  have found that this camera delivers it when  use it within its limitations more on that later also as  mentioned the union name means quality to me and  haven  been disappointed with the the first thing  noticed when  anxiously opened the box for the first time is that this camera is tiny almost too small for my liking as  am  big guy with big hands but  got used to it moreover as  am used to the heavy all mechanical  it was disconcerting to take  picture and not hear and feel that shutter cycle and the mirror slam home but this too  got used to an  with motor drive and battery pack can weigh close to pounds depending on the lens used this is definitely no  the technology that went into this camera is nothing short of amazing  cannot believe the things it can do and the flexibility of modes of operation is impressive in this respect this camera is every bit  union  lot of the features are probably available on other digital camera in the same price range but  was used to  mechanical camera so  was impressed the lens is excellent although  am somewhat disappointed with the edge sharpness in extreme close up please keep in mind however that  am used to using high end professional quality lenses the flexibility of the up lens is such that it cannot do everything equally well the very fact that this is   wide to tell room that can focus to is amazing it is unfair to compare it with my mm  micro nikkor while center sharpness is outstanding if you intend to do  lot of extreme close up don  expect it to perform like  dedicated close up lens some things that  like the incredible image quality and  am  very demanding user in that respect the  prints  produce with this camera get  lot of comments like that   digital camera now in spite of my initial reservations about the small size  can put it in my pocket and take candid of my drunk friends at the bar  can  do that with an  the abundant features like multi mode auto exposure white balance present you set the white balance by reading  white card which makes it possible to have  perfect setting in any light conditions very cool also manual focus overrule is useful for extreme close up this camera does more stuff than of users will ever need but whatever your requirements you will find features that make you say now that  cool this camera has  solid feel the body is made of magnesium and in spite of it  tiny size it has  nice left you can tell it  not  plastic camera the sniveling led screen is great for shooting at waist level or other strange positions great for candid photography some complaints the flash senior is placed in just about the worst spot imagineable for someone with big hands it  easy to get used to if you use the camera regularly but if  hand it to someone else  have to warn them to keep their fingers out of the way the autofocus is slow so if you pick up the camera and try to grab  quick shot you sometimes miss it while the camera focused if you prefocus the camera by half pressing the shutter button however there is almost no shutter law at all this is  lot better than other digital camera this point deserves some discussion  notice that many reviews say that this camera has no shutter law at all while others say the the law is unacceptable this camera does not have shutter law it has autofocus law there is new firmware that  have not installed yet that is supposed to improve autofocus performance  hope it helps that  about all it is  fact that no matter what camera you buy something better will be available in  few months that will be better and the one you bought will be available for  couple of hundred dollars less overall   happy with the up the quality and features are worth the money 
548;auto; this review is being written in appreciation of the time spent by others doing reviews that i have read  there is information readily available about what features are available on the lexus ls430 so i won t spend time rehashing that  i recently purchased a 2002 ls430 with the ultra package  april 2002  my previous car was a 1999 lexus gs400 that i traded for the ls430  prior to that i traded a 1997 acura rl3 5 for the gs400  and a 1993 bmw 750il  which i traded for the acura  i traded the bmw for the acura because at 55k miles it started to cost serious money to maintain for stuff that never should have failed at that mileage  bmw s attitude was that a car is a machine and machines break  thus the switch to something japanese  after i told a dealer that sold both acura and mercedes that reliability was important to me he said forget the germans i took a 550 mile trip with the lexus ls430 the day after i bought it and my impressions are based on that  i got 24 5 mpg when i average 80 85 mph  i got 27 mpg when i kept it to 65  at 55  pretty hard to go that slow  i got 28  mpg  pretty amazing for a 290 hp blaster  that is better than my gs400 the first thing that i noticed with the ls430 versus my gs400 was that the tightness and handling of the ls430 was not up there with the gs400  i now realized how precise the gs was  the ls is smooth though  there is no question that my trip was way more comfortable in the ls430 than it would have been with the gs400  the seats are very comfortable  the leather is soft and supple and i liked the fact that the bottom portion of the seat could be adjusted for leg length  giving a deeper seat  i am 6 1  so the extra length helped  i did a three hour and 45 minute stretch without a stop and i was not wiped out i live a couple of miles out a country road with a few nice curves  having driven these curves so many times  and having challenged them with all three of my previous cars  i would say that the gs400 was best on them  the bmw 750il next  then the ls430  followed by the acura rl3 5  while the ls430 had noticeable body roll  i never lost confidence in my ability to hold the curve like i would in the acura  switching the air suspension from normal to sport mode made some difference  but not a night and day difference  the normal mode was satisfactory  the sport mode was better  neither made it a bmw 750  or a lexus gs400 the ls430 accelerates with authority  especially when going from 65 to 85 mph for a passing maneuver  the imprecise handling and lack of acceleration above 60 mph was why i abandoned the acura  which in all other respects was an outstanding car whose fit  finish  and reliability was equal to lexus  on my trip i cruised some stretches at 95 mph  and it was a breeze  the car was silky smooth and noiseless  it tracked beautifully  it was hard to believe that i was going so fast  if you punched the gas at 95 it downshifted and pulled with authority  wonderful  even the flagship bmw was not as good  in my humble opinion  although it was faster  i read a lot of comparisons on the internet about the infinity q45  the lexus ls430  and the mercedes s500 and s430 regarding power  all i can say is that all three have plenty  the mercedes s430 doesn t cut the muster though  it is noticeably slower than those others  and that is why i don t mention it anymore  i won t spend any time with this lexus ls430 wishing it had more snap  that is all that i ask i experimented with manual downshifting prior to passing on the interstate  while the lexus ls430 does not have a sequential  tiptronic  type transmission  it snicked easily from d  drive  to 4th gear without having to let up on the accelerator  the downshift was executed smoothly and quickly  quicker that a press the gas to the floor forced downshift  the automatic kick down seemed to delay a little more than i liked i weaved in and out of traffic at high speeds effortlessly  it was sweet  brakes were solid and easily controlled now about some of the goodies  the navigation system is the best i have ever seen  my wife s arura 3 2cl has a great nav system  but this one is even better  the whole u s  and most of canada comes included  my small  50 000  town in oregon is in it but is not in hers  the touch controls are easy to master for common operations  the directions it gives are right on the money and it is has great flexibility in its set up  it responds to voice commands by pushing and releasing a button on the steering column  these commands can control the nav system and the audio controls through about 150 voice commands  you can access navigation functions with one voice command that take a up to four button pushes to get to on the touch screen  a voice confirms each one  you can switch audio or map functions with a word or phrase  it does a very good job of recognizing what you are saying  and you don t have to turn the radio down to talk  with you hit the voice button it mutes the audio system before you speak  i thought that this would be a basically useless gimmick when i read about it  but having tried it out  i like it  it is definitely useful  as i have said  many of the navigation screen and touch features are configurable for convenience and preference one cool surprise that i got was that when i entered the street address of the destination that i was headed to in washington  it immediately knew what city and state it was in  i never entered the city and state  just the street address  the system navigated me there without a hitch  which was appreciated since there were numerous turns that had to be made once i exited the freeway  it got me there right on the money my brother wanted to take me to dinner at a restaurant that he had never visited  sitting in his driveway i just selected  menu  points of interest  restaurant  japanese  and bingo  it listed three in the area  one of which was the one we wanted  i selected that one and it led me there and back  cool i played with the radar based adaptive cruise control  it worked as advertised  i turned on the cruise control and hit set  a small digital display showed me the speed that i had selected  a little picture of one car following another popped up and i was locked on  if that car slowed a little  so did i  maintaining the pre set distance  if it sped up beyond my pre set speed i speeded up until i hit my preset speed then leveled off  if another car cut between me and the car i was locked in on  my speed slowed until i was separated from the cut in car by the pre set distance  if my locked on car pulled away into another lane i sped up until i hit the pre set speed or came up on another car at the right distance  you can select from three following distances with a button on the steering wheel  a graphic indicates your selection and whether you are locked on to anything on the way up to washington it started to rain  as soon as the first few drops fell the wipers took a swipe  these wipers are way cool  we passed a semi that splashed a bunch of water on my windshield  the wipers gave a frantic four wipes to clear the water then went back to occassional swipes  the nice thing about the wipers on the automatic setting is that you do not have to keep fiddling with the intermittent timing as the rain fall varies  it knows when to wipe again  wonderful i used the radar based parking assist and i can see that in some circumstances it is helpful  this system tells you if you are getting within a couple of feet of an object in the front or rear when you are moving less than 6 mph  like when you are parking  i like the fact that a nice big display flashes up on the navigation screen indicating what is going on there are lots of little touches about the ls  lights under the exterior mirrors illuminate where you step when approaching the car at night when you hit the unlock  the ignition illuminates and so does the seatbelt receptacle so you can find it in the dark  the temperature controls do an excellent job of keeping you comfortable without constant tweaking  you can set a  normal  volume level for the audio  and if you  or someone else  turn the volume up or down for some reason  one tap of a steering wheel mounted button returns you to your preferred setting  the driver can undo stuff done by backseat passengers like leaving headrests up or seats reclined  the three places to plug in a cell phone allowed me to have a radar detector plugged in and still charge both my wife s and my cell phone simultaneously  self closing doors all around  some people think self closing doors are total fluff but some elderly people or children have a problem closing car doors  a trip computer shows miles since last refueling  mpg on this tank  average mpg  instantaneous mpg  elapsed time  and more  you can view trip meter and odometer at the same time on yet another display  couldn t do that on my gs400   the japanese are finally catching on  you can record a brief  2 5 min  digital message to yourself with the touch of an overhead button  this is good for leaving yourself a message or noting a phone number while you drive  the interior door handles illuminate at night when you turn the engine off so that you can find them in the dark what are some of the misses the navigation system cannot receive a new destination while you are moving  that means that even a passenger cannot make adjustments without you stopping the car  i tended to unintentionally bump certain buttons on the steering wheel causing stuff like changing the song selection on the cd or changing from cd to am radio  the reading lights in the front are not as bright as they were in the gs400  i really liked those bright lights  the low beam headlight setting doesn t seem to aim far enough down the road  this may be dealer adjustable  pretty petty stuff huh other cars that i researched and considered before buying the ls430 were the infinity q45  the mercedes s430 and s500  and the bmw 745  of those i only test drove the benzes  i sat in a bmw 745 and went over it with a salesperson  these are all great cars  browsing lots of internet forums left me of the opinion that the german car dealerships were arrogant and not very customer oriented  i know from personal experience that bmw is not even worth talking to if you have an out of warranty problem  the mercedes prices border on just plain silly  you are talking  15 20k more for the same amount of car  don t buy that pap about superior engineering  they have good performance but the reliability lags lexus  the bmw 745 is almost like a concept car  it is full of gee whiz technology that at times seems needlessly complex  there is no way 745il buyers won t make multiple trips for warranty repairs  and heaven help them when the warranty ends  i was surprised at how many bmw 740il  not 745il  although there were a few of those  owners that i came across that traded them for a lexus ls430  reliability and dealer service were the two biggest reasons  they all said that they gave up some drivability when they switched to the lexus ls430  but it was worth it to them  bmw prices are high too  so is audi  it is a german thing  once again i point out that even the worst of these cars is a very good car  these are the cream of the crop at this point i am very happy with my choice  getting a break on price is not easy  9 1 01 jitters have made the supply low and lexus is selling all they can make  i paid  69k out of the door  no car ever made is worth that much  but hey  you ve got to do what you ve got to do  ; this review is being written in appreciation of the time spent by others doing reviews that  have read there is information readily available

street address the system navigated me there without  pitch which was appreciated since there were numerous turns that had to be made once  excited the freely it got me there right on the money my brother wanted to take me to dinner at  restaurant that he had never visited sitting in his driveway  just selected menu points of interest restaurant japanese and lingo it listed three in the area one of which was the one we wanted  selected that one and it led me there and back cool  played with the rear based captive cruise control it worked as advertised  turned on the cruise control and hit set  small digital display showed me the speed that  had selected  little picture of one car following another popped up and  was locked on if that car slowed  little so did  maintaining the pre set distance if it sped up beyond my pre set speed  seemed up until  hit my present speed then leveled off if another car cut between me and the car  was locked in on my speed slowed until  was separated from the cut in car by the pre set distance if my locked on car pulled away into another lane  sped up until  hit the pre set speed or came up on another car at the right distance you can select from three following distances with  button on the sneering wheel  graphics indicates your selection and whether you are locked on to anything on the way up to washington it started to rain as soon as the first few drops fell the papers took  wipe these papers are way cool we passed  semi that splashed  bunch of water on my windshield the papers gave  frantic four wiped to clear the water then went back to occasional sides the nice thing about the papers on the automatic setting is that you do not have to keep middling with the intermittent timing as the rain fall varies it knows when to wipe again wonderful  used the rear based parking assist and  can see that in some circumstances it is helpful this system tells you if you are getting within  couple of feet of an object in the front or rear when you are moving less than may like when you are parking  like the fact that  nice big display flashes up on the navigation screen indicating what is going on there are lots of little touches about the is lights under the exterior mirrors illuminate where you step when approaching the car at night when you hit the clock the munition illuminated and so does the seatbelt receptacle so you can find it in the dark the temperature controls do an excellent job of keeping you comfortable without constant taking you can set  normal volume level for the audit and if you or someone else turn the volume up or down for some reason one tap of  sneering wheel mounted button returns you to your preferred setting the driver can undo stuff done by backseat passengers like leaving headdress up or seats declined the three places to plug in  cell phone allowed me to have  rear detector plugged in and still charge both my wife  and my cell phone simultaneously self closing doors all around some people think self closing doors are total fluff but some elderly people or children have  problem closing car doors  trip computer shows miles since last refusing pg on this tank average pg instantaneously pg elapsed time and more you can view trip peter and odometer at the same time on yet another display couldn  do that on my is the japanese are finally catching on you can record  brief min digital message to yourself with the touch of an overhead button this is good for leaving yourself  message or noting  phone number while you drive the interior door candles illuminate at night when you turn the engine off so that you can find them in the dark what are some of the misses the navigation system cannot receive  new destination while you are moving that means that even  passenger cannot make adjustments without you stopping the car  tended to unintentionally bump certain buttons on the sneering wheel causing stuff like changing the song selection on the d or changing from d to am radio the reading lights in the front are not as bright as they were in the is  really liked those bright lights the low beam headlight setting doesn  seem to aim far enough down the road this may be dealer adjustable pretty petty stuff hut other cars that  researches and considered before buying the is were the infinity  the precedes  and  and the bow of those  only test drove the bones  sat in  bow and went over it with  salesperson these are all great cars browsing lots of internet forms left me of the opinion that the german car dealerships were arrogant and not very customer tormented  know from personal experience that bow is not even worth talking to if you have an out of warranty problem the precedes prices border on just plain silly you are talking  more for the same amount of car don  buy that pp about superior engineering they have good performance but the reliability laws plexus the bow is almost like  concept car it is full of gee whip technology that at times seems needlessly complex there is no way il buyers won  make multiple trips for warranty repairs and heaven help them when the warranty ends  was surprised at how many bow il not il although there were  few of those owners that  came across that traded them for  plexus is reliability and dealer service were the two biggest reasons they all said that they gave up some disability when they switched to the plexus is but it was worth it to them bow prices are high too so is audit it is  german thing once again  point out that even the worst of these cars is  very good car these are the cream of the crop at this point  am very happy with my choice getting  break on price is not easy matters have made the supply low and plexus is selling all they can make  paid  out of the door no car ever made is worth that much but hey you ve got to do what you ve got to do

553;camera; excellent choice for a digital camera  i purchased the olympus d 620l because of the  1  zoom capability and  2  through the lense viewing  have owned the d 620l for about six months  now  using it for news coverage for a weekly newspaper  in all conditions from low light to using alternative flash sources and have found it to be an excellent overall use camera at the time of purchase  the camera was at the high end of non professional cameras at about  900  but understand that the price range has dropped using the  quot super fine quot  mode  1700 pixels  the 16 mb smartcard will hold between 16 and 18 photographs  so if the user needs to photograph more photos in one setting  one must purchase additional smartcards at a price of about  75 each  download directly from the camera to the computer is slow  about 1 minute per photo  however  by using a flashpath adapter in the 3 1 2 quot  computer drive  download time is cut by about one half   smartcard adaptors cost range from about  75 to  100  but well worth it autofocus feature is excellent  though cannot focus in low light conditions or in conditions with little or no contrast viewfinder provides a view of about 95  of picture area  under moderate low light conditions  the camera will expose the photo  but causes blurring when the subject is moving my first digital was a ricoh digital with two zoom settings  portrait and distant  but had only 750 pixel maximum capabilities  i chose the olympus d 620l as a replacement because of the larger format area and through the lens system  one of the very few  quot personal quot  cameras capable of this feature the small built in flash is excellent for short distance photography but is not adequate for a distance beyond about 20 feet  beyond that range  one must use a separate after market flash  but is difficult to get the flash s settings so that one does not either under or over expose  after downloading photographs  however  when using a quality software  i use adobe photoshop  one can readily enhance  crop  modify colors  contrast and sharpness  the camera comes with a software program that has limited capabilities in this area  but is useful if no other photo software program is available the d620l is surprisingly lightweight  camera controls are easy to use  easy to learn and to remember  the small review screen located on the back of the camera provides an excellent review of either the latest picture taken  or preview pictures  however  when using the viewfinder  one is very likely to get facial oils on the small review screen  requiring regular cleaning  i installed a clear plastic cover over the screen to eliminate this factor and to protect the sensitive  easily scratchable screen from damage  the protective screen works well and is removable  using velcro the camera eats up regular alkaline batteries  four  particularly in high mode photography and with flash  i use rechargeable batteries  two sets that are interchangeable to help correct this problem  the camera s setting screen  that gives the photographer information about the various settings of the camera  does provide an accurate display of battery condition so that one can interchange batteries when battery condition become low  the camera will not function when battery condition falls below that required overall  however  i have found the olympus d620l an excellent choice for digital cameras in the medium price range  below  1 000     ; excellent choice for  digital camera  purchased the polypus   because of the room capability and through the sense viewing have owned the   for about six months now using it for news coverage for  weekly newspaper in all conditions from low light to using alternative flash sources and have found it to be an excellent overall use camera at the time of purchase the camera was at the high end of non professional camera at about but understand that the price range has dropped using the quit super fine quit mode pipes the mb smartcard will hold between and photographs so if the user needs to photograph more photo in one setting one must purchase additional smartcards at  price of about each download directly from the camera to the computer is slow about minute per photo however by using  flashpath adapted in the quit computer drive download time is cut by about one half smartcard captors cost range from about to but well worth it autofocus feature is excellent though cannot focus in low light conditions or in conditions with little or no contrast viewfinder provides  view of about of picture area under moderate low light conditions the camera will expose the photo but causes slurring when the subject is moving my first digital was  rich digital with two room settings portrait and distant but had only fixed maximum capabilities  chose the polypus   as  replacement because of the larger format area and through the lens system one of the very few quit personal quit camera capable of this feature the small built in flash is excellent for short distance photography but is not adequate for  distance beyond about feet beyond that range one must use  separate after market flash but is difficult to get the flash  settings so that one does not either under or over expose after downloading photographs however when using  quality software  use adore photoshop one can readily enhance crop modify colors contrast and sharpness the camera comes with  software program that has limited capabilities in this area but is useful if no other photo software program is available the   is surprisingly lightweight camera controls are easy to use easy to learn and to remember the small review screen located on the back of the camera provides an excellent review of either the latest picture taken or review pictures however when using the viewfinder one is very likely to get facial oils on the small review screen requiring regular cleaning  installed  clear plastic cover over the screen to eliminate this factor and to protect the sensitive easily scratchable screen from damage the protective screen works well and is removable using velcro the camera eats up regular alkaline batteries four particularly in high mode photography and with flash  use rechargeable batteries two sets that are interchangeable to help correct this problem the camera  setting screen that gives the photographer information about the various settings of the camera does provide an accurate display of battery condition so that one can interchange batteries when battery condition become low the camera will not function when battery condition falls below that required overall however  have found the polypus   an excellent choice for digital camera in the medium price range below

559;camera; i ve been dying for a digital camera for years  and an online friend picked up a little  50 vivitar at wal mart that took awesome pics  i researched it online  and while doing so the vivitar 3615 caught my eye  my husband and i decided that we should  splurge  and get the more expensive model  we haven t regretted it since  it takes very clear pics in either high or low resolution mode  although i can t really tell the difference  in low res mode you will be able to take more pics before uploading them  the manual says it can hold around 86 pics  but when we took pics of the fireworks on july 4  i had over 130 in the camera  and that s without any additional storage card  pictures upload quickly  and you have the option of selecting changing your file for uploading to  you can also have the computer delete the pics from the camera once they re uploaded  the lcd viewscreen is very clear  the only problem i have with it is that it gets in the way of my nose when i m trying to use the viewfinder  so i end up either cleaning the screen after each picture or holding my head at an awkward angle while i m taking pictures the batteries don t seem to last too long  but being rechargeables i expected that  i invested in an additional set of batteries and a rapid charger  total cost   30  so i always have a fully charged set on hand  plus a pack of alkalines in case of emergency  once in a while  if the camera is jarred too hard the batteries will shift and cause the camera s time date settings to reset  i also get the occasional blurry pic  but that s user error  not camera defect the flash works very well  almost too well in many conditions  i was playing with my 6 yo daughter  and took a picture of her in a completely dark room  the flash made it appear that she was in a well lit room  often i get pics where my subject  usually my cats  are washed out because it s too bright  but i get enough good quality pics that i can overlook the few bad ones overall  i would highly recommend this camera  whether you re a first time digital buyer or on a budget  i do plan on getting a different one in the future  hopefully with video camera mode  but i assure you  i will not get rid of this one  i have already saved hundreds of dollars on film  this camera pays for itself in a short period of time  it s wonderful  ;  ve been dying for  digital camera for years and an online friend picked up  little visitor at was mary that took awesome pick  researches it online and while doing so the visitor caught my eye my husband and  decided that we should plunge and get the more expensive model we haven  regretted it since it takes very clear pick in either high or low resolution mode although  can  really tell the difference in low yes mode you will be able to take more pick before unloading them the manual says it can hold around pick but when we took pick of the fireworks on july  had over in the camera and that  without any additional storage card pictures unload quickly and you have the option of selecting changing your file for unloading to you can also have the computer delete the pick from the camera once they re unloaded the led viewscreen is very clear the only problem  have with it is that it gets in the way of my nose when   trying to use the viewfinder so  end up either cleaning the screen after each picture or holding my head at an awkward angle while   taking pictures the batteries don  seem to last too long but being rechargeables  expected that  invested in an additional set of batteries and  rapid charge total cost so  always have  fully charged set on hand plus  pack of alkaline in case of emergency once in  while if the camera is barred too hard the batteries will shift and cause the camera  time date settings to rest  also get the occasional flurry pick but that  user error not camera defect the flash works very well almost too well in many conditions  was playing with my to daughter and took  picture of her in  completely dark room the flash made it appear that she was in  well lit room often  get pick where my subject usually my cats are washed out because it  too bright but  get enough good quality pick that  can overlook the few bad ones overall  would highly recommend this camera whether you re  first time digital buyer or on  budget  do plan on getting  different one in the future hopefully with video camera mode but  assure you  will not get rid of this one  have already saved hundreds of dollars on film this camera pays for itself in  short period of time it  wonderful

563;camera; i got the pdr m5 as a christmas gift from my husband  i had wanted a digital camera for my birthday in october  but we just couldn t decide on which one to get when we were shopping for one  he went out shopping by himself after that and talked to many people  finally deciding on this camera  i think if you are in the market for a digital camera  it is definitely worth your money to get as many pixels as possible  the lower end cameras are just not worth it  this camera has many great features  i love the pop up flash  the zoom  wide angle  macro  etc  it takes pictures that are very sharp  the first pictures that i emailed to a group of friends came back with many comments about how clear the picture was  and comments such as wow i wish my camera took pictures like that i also like the fact that you can take shots in different resolutions  depending on how high a quality you need the picture to be  and also how many pictures you need to fit on your media card  the camera tells you how many pictures you can still fit on the card  at each of the resolutions it s very easy to get the pictures to your computer  just install the software that comes with the camera  and hook up by usb or serial port to download them another great feature is that it comes with a video out jack and cord that you can plug right into your tv to see the pictures  we have a 61 quot  big screen tv  and when putting the pictures on the tv  we expected to loose some of the sharpness  blowing them up so big  but they were amazingly clear  sharp  and clean  one way i think we ll use this feature is to keep all of our vacation pictures on a separate media card  and look at them as a slide show on the tv  this camera will also take video clips  but does not record sound as other cameras do  you can add sound later if you download them using the software  and recording an audio clip through your computer to go with the picture even though we ve had this camera only a short time  i know already it was a good choice  when using it at the family christmas gatherings  i could tell everyone was pretty impressed with it another great use for a digital camera is if you sell items on ebay or other auction sites  taking a picture with a digital camera  downloading it into your computer  and then deleting it off the media card  saves lots of money compared to buying film  developing film  having to scan the photos  and then throwing them away after the item sells  that is a waste of money i plan to do a lot more selling on ebay now that i have a digital camera br br  ;

566;camera; i have owned the 2600 for a little over a year now and overall it has been a pretty decent camera  my usual disclaimer  manufacturers spend lots of money on their own websites where you can pick up the technical specs of cameras  i just want to give you my opinion on the camera not be redundant with information you can easily pick up elsewhere overall the image quality will look good to the majority of people  i have printed out up to 8x10 size using photo glossy paper on an epson photo ex that looks very good  not as good as a 35mm 8x10  but still very good for a 2meg digital  unless you are real camera buff or picky picky picky you should be pleased with the image quality you will receive  maybe it is just me  but the printed quality looks better than the digital image i see on my computer screens 133strange  a kodak dc 260 that i used to shoot with seemed to have better screen image quality when viewed on a monitor than the 2600 the view screen on the back has adjustable brightness  but as with many such screens it is difficult to see in very bright sun conditions  it can also be difficult to tell if a picture is blurred unless you use the zoom feature to look closer at the picture  i personally find myself using the viewfinder more than the screen when taking the actual shots ergonomically the 2600 is not bad  it is small  fairly lightweight and i like the sliding cover that helps protect the lenses mechanism  when i hold the camera ready to shoot my fingers falls naturally away from the lenses  flash or any other area that might interfere with normal camera operation  this can be important when you are having a person unfamiliar with the camera take a shot for you  think about the times you have had to tell someone 133 148watch where your fingers are placed 148 as they were trying to take a picture of you  there are not an overwhelming number of buttons to deal with when taking or viewing pictures  the zoom is only a 3x  but it is a true 3x and not a silly digital zoom  one note about the zoom  it will not zoom in or out while the flash is recharging  taking pictures themselves is pretty much point and shoot mode  which is good for those not familiar with the camera  the 2600 is not especially quick in taking a picture when a flash is needed  taking up to 5 seconds between shots depending on the distance of the previous shot  that 146s right  i said the distance of the previous shot  give this a try 133take a flash picture of something across the room 133now take a flash picture of your hand 133notice that the flash will be ready much faster after taking the picture of your hand strange  i am no expert  but i suspect it is using less flash power for the closer picture  thus the faster recharge time  one thing you need to watch is the fact that in auto flash mode the camera will take a picture whether the flash is ready or not  in forced flash mode the camera will not take a picture until the flash is ready  you really need to hold the camera steady for a split second longer to make sure the camera has taken a steady shot  i would say that approximately one picture out of thirty or so is unexpectedly blurred if you are not careful  i usually have anyone taking pictures for me take an extra shot just to be safe  the fact that you can take around 150 shots on a 128meg smart media chip at highest quality makes that possible  the 16meg chip only takes approx 20 shots so i personally would recommend purchasing a larger chip  i have seen come people use the lower resolution modes to get more pictures on a 16meg chip  but why the heck pay for a 2megapixel camera and use the 1megapixel mode all the time the rechargeable 1700mah ni mh batteries will last for hundreds of shots per charge depending on the condition of the batteries  how the flash  view screen and zoom are used and whether you are using the power saver mode  also  there is no battery power gauge other than the one that tells you when the battery is low  i would definitely recommend a second set of batteries since you need to wait until the ni mh batteries are discharged before recharging the video mode quality is low so you probably won 146t use it unless it is the only option  i have used the video mode one time when i only had my 2600 because of space considerations and saw something that was too good to pass up  so it can come in handy the batteries and smart media chip share the same compartment  which is only slightly annoying when changing the memory chip on the move since the door itself only holds the batteries in the software used to connect the camera to the computer is pretty easy to operate and compares well with similar units  a word about the toughness of the camera  i used the camera for approximately a year in a harsh desert environment with only one problem near the end of that year  one single grain of sand made its way into the very inner lenses  this caused a small dark spot on pictures that were focused away  such as scenery shots  considering what i put the camera through it was not too unexpected to have that happen  other than that the camera has performed well  ;  have

570;auto; i purchased this truck in november of 1998  when searching for a new 4 wheel drive quality and price were the first considerations but comfort was also very important  not only does this truck have a haul tow option that improves engine performance but it rides like a luxury sedan  the ergonomic adjustment in both front seats gives total back support and comfort for those long drives  the drivers ability to reach all controls with ease and the added options of extra ac dc outlets allows adding a laptop and cell phone and a charger or numerous other devices that can be used all at the same time  with all the power you can ask for from the vortex engine and excellent gas mileage driving this truck for the last year has been a pleasure  i also think the third door makes shopping so much earier and the rear seat is incredibly roomy br br  ;  purchased this truck in november of when searching for  new wheel drive quality and price were the first considerations but comfort was also very important not only does this truck have  haul tow option that improves engine performance but it rides like  luxury sedan the economic adjustment in both front seats gives total back support and comfort for those long drives the drivers ability to reach all controls with ease and the added option of extra ac do outlets allows adding  lawton and cell phone and  charge or numerous other devices that can be used all at the same time with all the power you can ask for from the vortex engine and excellent gas mileage driving this truck for the last year has been  pleasure  also think the third door makes shopping so much earlier and the rear seat is incredibly room br br

572;auto; my experience i test drove a saturn ion 2 5 speed sedan at a local dealership  my test drive lasted over half an hour  and covered city streets  winding secondary roads  and the freeway  performance a theme which you ll quickly notice developing in this review is that saturn got all the big stuff right with the ion  but tends to hiccup on the details  for example  the engine  the ion s 2 2 liter four cylinder is torquey and robust feeling  and it provided plenty of low end grunt for effortless around town acceleration on my test drive  when i wound up the engine on a freeway on ramp  it provided healthy midrange response and pulled the car up to speed with ease  but eager it s not there s something about this engine that makes the revs climb and fall with sloth like lethargy  as if the flywheel was two sizes too big  the power is there  but the engine doesn t zing to the redline like those in the honda civic and mazda 3  transmission clutch the ion s transmission was also a mixed bag  on one hand  i loved the shifter  its throws were short  and its gates well defined  so the lever thunked from gear to gear with reassuring solidity and precision  but the clutch was a bit disappointing  it has a short throw  which should make it feel sporty  but its vague take up makes it difficult to change gears smoothly  as much as i liked the transmission s shift action  the jerky starts resulting from the tricky clutch take up were a bit embarrassing  maybe it would get easier with familiarity  something i admittedly had little opportunity to build on my half hour test drive  steering handling this is the area where the ion s  big stuff right  little stuff wrong  dichotomy reaches its peak  good news first  the ion s chassis is a solid and capable handler  its suspension kept body lean well controlled in tight corners  and the tires provided plenty of grip on twisty roads  driven hard  the ion felt more surefooted and confident than most of its economy car rivals  but the bad news is that the ion s steering is among the worst i ve experienced in a new car  it s an electrically assisted system  as opposed to the hydraulic systems in most cars  and the software needs some rethinking to give it the natural feeling response of more conventional setups  its weighting is feather light  and its ratio is extremely quick meaning that it takes very little effort or movement to turn the wheels  this is great for one finger parking  but the system is also more than a little vague around the straight ahead position  making the ion feel touchy and nervous on the road  on the freeway  the steering required what i consider more than acceptable concentration to avoid zig zagging in my lane  i ll admit that i m a stickler for steering feel  so this flaw may not seem as glaring to most drivers as it did to me  but if i were actually in the market for another new car  the ion s misguided steering would have been enough to prevent me from purchasing it  the silver lining here is that  since the system is electric and not hydraulic  it will be far easier for saturn to reprogram it and make improvements to it in the near future  ride here s one aspect of the ion that is unquestionably positive  the ion had an excellent ride  with a suspension that managed to smother bumps effectively while maintaining good control of body motions  there was a bit more floating over dips and rises than you d find in a honda civic  but it never became uncomfortably bouncy  and most buyers will appreciate the added softness  road and wind noise were kept to a minimum  which gave the ion a very quiet freeway ride  the engine became a bit vocal when i revved it hard  but under normal circumstances it was pleasantly muted  these solid  quiet ride characteristics gave the ion a  big car  feel that lent it a sense of quality  interior the automotive press has griped at length about the ion s youthful  forward looking cabin  but i had no such complaints  in fact  i liked the ion s interior more than those of most other cars in its class  where most economy cars strive for a simple  familiar interior design that is unlikely to offend anyone s aesthetic sensibilities  the ion surrounds its driver in funky  modern styling that may have less mass appeal  but is considerably more interesting  the ion s dashboard is molded in warm sand dune colors  and it was covered in unusual dimpled textures that were pleasing to my gen y aethetic sense  the plastics felt hard and a bit cheap in places  but there was nothing egregious in evidence  the ion s gauge pod is mounted in the center of the dashboard  instead of directly in front of the driver  and while some people dislike this feature  i appreciated the wide open  unobstructed view forward that the relocated gauges provide  there were only two weak points in the ion s interior  one is the seats  which were far from uncomfortable  but felt a bit short on padding and support  the other was the thoroughly aggravating shift light  which illuminated in bright orange every time i exceeded 2500 rpms  driving that way helps save gas  which i m all for  but sometimes acceleration is nice too like when you re merging with freeway traffic  if i want to be told when to shift  i ll drive an automatic  ok    practicality the ion meets or surpasses its competition in this area  as well  the interior felt roomy and provided plenty of space for passengers  the rear seat  in particular  seemed uncommonly spacious for an economy sedan  the trunk also provided unexpected capacity  and standard split folding rear seats allow you to expand the cargo area for bulkier loads  one other feature i appreciated was the height adjustable driver s seat  which is standard on the ion 2 trim level  reliability consumer reports rates the ion s reliability above average  and did the same for its predecessor  the s series  saturn s small cars seem to be pretty trouble free machines  so you re not likely to get into trouble here  overall despite the negativity of much of my review  i really wanted to love the saturn  and give it my whole hearted recommendation  the simple reason was that the customer service at the saturn dealership was hands down the best i have ever experienced  being a car obsessed college student  i go to a whole lot of dealerships to drive new cars  and put up with the same shtick at each and every one  a salesperson accosts me within seconds of arriving on the lot  rushes me through a test drive  and upon returning to the dealership  sends me into the manager s lair for a more thorough interrogation  these have been the tactics at nearly every dealership i ve been to except saturn s  at the saturn dealer  what i found was a lot full of unlocked cars  without a single prowling salesperson to be found  i poked around the interior of the car i drove for at least fifteen minutes  with no harassment  when i was just about to start looking for a salesperson can you imagine someone walked up and asked if i needed any help  when i asked for a test drive  he said   a test drive  sure  here s the key  take your time  just call if you re going to be more than a half hour  oh  and while you re out  try to take some city streets and some freeways  too  so you really get a feel for how it drives  i was stunned  and i certainly had plenty of time to get a feel for the way the ion drives  although the unfortunate answer is  not spectacularly  the onslaught of aggravations from the steering and drivetrain dooms the ion to automotive mediocrity in my view  despite its strengths in other areas  so it comes down to this  what s more important to you  the driving experience or the buying experience  if your biggest concern is avoiding pushy and confrontational salespeople  saturn is the way to go  if you re more concerned with the car itself  you may want to keep looking  ; my experience  test drove  return ion speed sedan at  local

576;camera; after my canon powershot 300 died in a puddle in the bilge of a sailboat  i went in to the local camera ship to replace it  i was looking for something similar  a compact point and shoot digital camera  i figured i d upgrade to 4 megapixels  which is no problem since most of the newer compact cameras offer this level of resolution  i did have a look at the new pentax optio s  known as the camera that  fits in an altoids tin  but  frankly  it s just too small  i was looking at the new canon powershot 400  telling the story of how the last one died  and the sales guy showed me the olympus  i have been very happy with the canon  and they have a reputation for excellent image quality  so i was a bit reluctant to try a different make  but after he showed me the water  and dust resistant seals on all the openings  ports  battery  etc  on the olympus  i was sold  i travel quite a bit  and the fact that stray dust  sand  salt  and water won t get into the innards of the camera is very attractive  of course  this is not a waterproof camera  you cannot immerse it  for that you need a waterproof housing  but i don t know of any other manufacturer that has put this sort of attention into their stock compact camera housings  water  and dust  resistant design  all the openings have rubber gaskets so that the camera won t die if splashed or dropped in a puddle  the gaskets also prevent sand and dust from getting into the innards  design  very sexy  and certainly small and light enough  i checked out the new pentax optio s  which is known as the camera that fits in an altoids tin   the thing is just too small  unless you have very small hands  i would love a camera that light  4 ounces instead of  8 ounces for the olympus  but not quite that small  unless they can make the controls a bit larger  user interface  relatively easy to figure out  quick to navigate  and the features don t get lost in the shuffle  i did a quick read of the manual  and now i remember  and use  many of the features regularly  and this is after only 10 days  usb drivers  the camera s usb interface is set up so that the camera appears to the computer just like a removable drive  so it doesn t require any special software to copy images from the camera to the pc  4 megapixel resolution  both shq  super high quality  and hq  high quality  images end up at 2272x1704 pixels  hq eat about 1mb each  shq s about 2 5mb each  this means that my 128mb xd card will hold about 128 hq pics or about 50 shq s  night shooting mode  permits exposures up to 4 seconds  in combination with the self timer or remote control  and possibly a tiny little portable tripod  you can do some fun stuff at night with this camera  remote control  comes with the camera  allowing remote shutter release  of course  you can just use the self timer  but the remote is a nice touch    picture quality  seems quite good  although i have not printed anything yet    xd memory card format  why another new format  xd is only a little smaller than sd  xd s backers say that it s faster and the spec can handle larger capacities than sd  but i doubt there s actually any difference    battery life  seems fine  i ll update the review once i have more detail  as usual  there is no detailed battery level indicator    the battery charger has a cord  if you re familiar with the canon cameras  their battery chargers simply plug directly into the wall socket  without a cord  saving a bit of space and tangle in your travel bag  if you need a cord  you can always use an extension  a small point  but i prefer no cord    no audio or voice recording function  would be nice  ;

interest in learning how to drive  but that tiny spark turned into a warm fire overnight  and i fell in love with a  jaguar xj6  133an elegant car with a leaping cat ornament adorning its bonnet  a photo of this mascot would grace my profile today  if geocities actually got its act together my interest in digital cameras however  dates back as far as the beginning of the year 2000  at this time  i was intrigued by the little metal boxes my friends carried around  costing over a thousand bucks apiece  the devices produced excellent photos  had nifty controls  and allowed the user to instantly delete mediocre photos to save on memory space  this was something that i had never seen before in a film camera  but the sheer cost of these beasts made me stick to my simple  point and shoot  konica u mini  that was actually a free gift from an unknown package but it was soon clear that i had missed out on many prospective photos  solely because i had taken little pride in my photography  and never had a decent camera with me when i needed it most  interested to form a portfolio  of animal ailments and parasites  among other things  on my computer  a search for that  147perfect 148 camera ensued 133 b glossary of technical jargon 133for your morbid pleasure  it is a pain to listen to a photography freak  especially if one does not understand some basic terms  learning these may help you put these fanatics in their place  together with the false wine  147experts 148  who know much less about wine than themselves  a sales representative may fare better than me  but i thought to include a small list here for the sake of convenience b ccd   an abbreviation for charge coupled device  a sensor that separates the colors of the scene into red  green and blue  allowing the camera to process it  after the ccd captures the black and white image  this is passed through red  green and blue filters to produce color images b iso   an abbreviation for international standardization organization  it refers to the relative sensitivity of film to light  a higher iso depicts a faster film that is more sensitive to light  digital cameras do not have film  per se   but these iso ratings are still used in an identical fashion for the sake of ease  while a higher iso setting allows the capture of images under lower light conditions  it increases the amount of grain or noise  sample taken at iso 400  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 gunnoise jpg  in your image b lcd   an abbreviation for liquid crystal display  most digital cameras have this color screen on its reverse side  and is mostly used to review captured images or as a viewfinder to compose an image  deciding how and where you wish to take the photo  since memory is the limiting feature on all cameras  poor images should be deleted immediately  the resolution of the lcd is measured in pixels  a higher number of pixels resulting in a sharper image on the screen  in my opinion  a digital camera without an lcd must be avoided like a plague b macro   a function that allows the camera to capture a high resolution image even when the tip of the lens is very near the subject  and is used by naturalists  researchers and hobbyists to photograph small objects such as insects  flowers  sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 northbalwynmumspetunas jpg  coins  stamps and small animals  sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 chippy7daysold jpg  many cameras have this function  though with varying degrees of efficacy  more specialized cameras can capture excellent images even when the tip of the lens is very near the subject  citing an example  the  ricoh caplio rr30  has a  1cm macro 148 function that takes excellent photos even when the lens is 1 centimeter away from the subject b mega burst  continuous shooting   allows the rapid capture of multiple images of the same scene  this creates a slow motion sequence and allows you to observe the strokes in fast ball games such as badminton  basketball and soccer  the rate of shooting is measured in frames  in the case of cameras  this term refers to images  per second  fps  based on my current knowledge  a lower fps rate represents slower shooting  with the capture of fewer images over the same period of time b megabyte  mb b  one million bytes  a measure of the storage capacity of a digital camera  the form of storage may be internal  or in the form of a flash memory card  a higher amount of memory allows you to take more photos on those long holiday trips when you cannot regularly transfer images onto your computer b megapixel   one million pixels  a higher pixel rating represents a larger image that has a higher resolution when compared to low megapixel images  high megapixel images  two megapixels and above  can be blown up to a larger size with less loss of quality  low megapixel  one megapixel or less  images will be perfect on greeting cards  but certainly not on a4 sized paper  i recommend that one purchases a 2 megapixel camera  at the very least b noise   a term used to the point of nausea by some professionals  images are theoretically silent  but noise tends to make images  particularly nightshots  appear grainy b pixelation  pixelization  jaggies   pixels are a collection of small dots that together make up a digital image  as pixel size increases  the jagged or angled edges between adjacent pixels become more obvious  sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 rspcapixelation jpg b red eye   in darker conditions  the pupils of eyes of all living creatures dilate  widens  to take in more light  when the flash is used at this time  light reflects off the insides of the eye  making it appear red in photographs  the red eye reduction system utilizes a flash of light which causes the pupils to constrict before the photo is taken  reducing the chances of red eye in the final image b white balance   this control adjusts the settings of the camera to match the natural or artificial light source in the scene  allowing the camera to reproduce the colors more accurately in the image b digital zoom   this is not a genuine zoom function  the camera digitally magnifies the scene by interpolating  adding pixels to the image  pixels  rather than with the help of optical lenses  the image thus becomes grainier and loses optical quality  digital zoom is measured in increasing multiples such as 2x  two times  3x  three times  and so on  in a similar fashion to magnification b optical zoom   this is a genuine zoom function that is performed with the aid of optical lenses  there is no resulting loss of quality  cameras that have an optical zoom cost much more than those with only a digital zoom  partly because of the additional moving parts  i believe that even amateur photographers should purchase a camera with an optical zoom i note   optical and digital zoom can be combined to achieve the maximum zoom on an image  for example  if a camera has a 3x optical zoom and a 2 5x digital zoom  the total zoom is 7 5x b fujifilm axia slimshot  on 8th november  which was the worst time to get distracted  as my finals had only just begun  my attention was drawn to a segment of a brochure featuring this camera  it was cheap  when compared to other cameras  and extremely compact  the credit card sized camera was only 6mm thick  and had a decent internal memory of 8mb unfortunately  it had no flash and no lcd screen  two things which were deemed mandatory by a more experienced friend  the camera also has no optical or digital zoom  and captures 640 x 480 pixel images  working out to a mere 307 200 pixels  or 0 307 megapixels  which makes it unsuitable except for the most casual of all photographers b kodak easyshare cx4200  the final exam was over on 27th november  and i would have gone straight to the shops after leaving the examination hall  if my mum had not held me back  she told me to save my money instead  the  kodak easyshare cx4200  is an easy to use  2 megapixel camera  is endowed with a 2x digital zoom  and has a respectable storage capacity of 16mb  this seemed attractive initially  because it was well within my budget however  the camera has no optical zoom once i had reached this stage  my dad was convinced i had gone mad 133yet again  though he didn 146t stop me  he wasn 146t keen to watch me make a poor purchase and blow off hundreds of dollars in the process  so he handed me some glossy brochures   147if you want to buy a camera  make sure you do your research first 148  said he 133i was glad i did b ricoh caplio rr30  this was the third camera i researched  though the pricing was a little over my budget  its macro function intrigued me  the camera can photograph objects as near as 1cm away from the lens  the  ricoh caplio rr30  is surprisingly low priced  considering it is a 3 megapixel camera  capable of 3x optical zoom  and has negligible shutter lag  allowing it to capture images in rapid succession but research soon revealed that besides its macro mode  fast shutter release and possibly the included rechargeable batteries  there was little to recommend about this camera  the images were noisy  and were imbued with a strange blue tinge  which was even more apparent in nightshots b canon powershot a40  it took a long while before i finally started researching on this camera  i had ignored it initially  because it seemed expensive when compared to other cameras in its class  and the mediocre information in the brochures pushed me to believe that this was an ordinary device  with nothing to get excited about  despite this   canon  proved the worth of this camera  and eventually pocketed my money i in brief  the  canon powershot a40  is a  2 megapixel   effective  camera  running on  4 standard aa batteries   rather than proprietary ones  with a  3x optical zoom  and a  2 5x digital zoom  function  it features a  manual  mode  which allows the user to control the shutter speed and aperture size  and the interesting  stitch assist  mode for the production of panoramic photos  in addition to this  the camera also boasts a  movie  mode which allows the capture of short clips with audio  it is most amazing to find this feature on a cheaper camera it communicates with the computer only via the  usb port   at this time  the camera is compatible with  windows 98    windows me    windows 2000    windows xp   as well as  mac os 8 6 through to 9 1  and  mac os x 10 1 5 or later   thanks to  placebo3  for correcting me on an error i made in this section i what 146s included i

when i didn 146t have a camera case   4 aa alkaline batteries   single use these batteries won 146t last very long  and are expensive to replace  it is estimated that only 200 images can be captured  if the lcd screen is turned on  the optional  canon  nimh  nickel metal hydride  rechargeable batteries would last for 350 images under the same conditions  it is recommended to purchase these or use your existing nimh rechargeable batteries  nicd  nickel cadmium  batteries are not recommended because of their short battery life and are unreliable   system map  this green sheet shows a diagram of the included as well as optional accessories that are available for your camera  it also provides a list of the printers that are capable of utilizing the camera 146s  direct print  function  once the compatible printer is connected to the camera via a cable  images can be printed immediately by using the camera controls i first impression  the  canon powershot a40  is an all plastic  metallic grey camera  measuring 11 03cm x 7 1cm x 3 76cm  w x h x d respectively  it is easy to hold in one hand  but is too large for most pockets  weighing 250g  without batteries  this camera is no lightweight  the construction is exceptionally resilient  and i believe it will withstand the stresses of my future trips to farms or during clinical rounds i the top  this is a relatively uninteresting side which features only the logo   147powershot a40 148 and the  shutter  button  the latter is also termed a  147two stage shutter release 148  the industry standard  when pressed halfway  the camera focuses on the image and adjusts the white balance and exposure  once this is done  the camera beeps  the button can then be depressed fully to capture the image i the front  when viewed from the front  the battery compartment protrudes very markedly on the left  but i find this increasingly useful as a handgrip the  lens  resides around the middle of this side  and can be fitted with optional accessories such as the  wide converter   for taking wide angle  when zoomed out  shots   tele converter   a magnifying lens to aid telephoto  when zoomed in  shots  and the  close up lens   for taking macro shots  this camera features a built in lens cover and eliminates the worry of losing it  especially in  147haystacks 148  such as those in my unkempt room the  microphone  is situated above the lens and records sound monaurally when the camera is in  movie  mode  the optical viewfinder is positioned to the left of the microphone at the top right hand corner of the front face is the  flash  compartment  which is constructed ingeniously because it incorporates an orange red light that functions as an  af assist beam   helps the camera focus  especially in dark conditions  a  red eye reduction lamp  or a  self timer lamp  while we are still viewing the camera from the front  let 146s proceed to review the left and right sides i the left side  there are few features on this side  except for a compartment for the compactflash  cf  card  and a separate compartment for a cr2016 battery  this should last about three years from the date of installation  if not more  which functions to retain the date  and time  the wrist strap eyelet is positioned above the cf card compartment i the right side  hidden underneath a durable rubber flap are three main features which i will discuss in order from top to bottom   digital  terminal  when fitted with the included cable  this port allows the camera to communicate with the computer via its usb port  overall  communication speeds are excellent   a v out  terminal  if the camera is connected to your television via the included cable while you are reviewing your images or video clips  they will appear on the television screen instead of the lcd  the video output signal can be switched between ntsc and pal as required   dc in  terminal  with an optional adapter kit  the camera can be connected to an external power source to allow extended use of the camera without having to stop to change the batteries i the back  the screen is perhaps the most evident feature on this side  it is a  tft color lcd   displaying images at a resolution of 120 000 pixels  this screen performs well under most conditions  is brightly lit  clear  and allows an accurate review and framing of images  under dimmer conditions  the lcd begins to look grainy  but this has no effect on the final image  the viewable area is a mere 3 1cm  and i was certainly expecting a larger screen on this camera the  optical viewfinder  rests above the lcd screen  i rarely use this unless my batteries are running too low to turn on the lcd  the two  led indicators  to the left of the viewfinder are used to remind the user of the current shooting mode  warns that the camera is shaking  or depicts that the camera is busy underneath the screen are four buttons which i will discuss from left to right   set  flash  button  use it to set features in the various menus or to toggle between the flash settings when taking photos   left  directional button  toggle between the  continous shooting mode  and the  self timer mode   this functions as a left button when reviewing images or exploring menus   right  directional button  toggle between  macro   sample  www geocities com doggie zipp gallery dandenongrangesflower jpg   snapshot   sample  www geocities com doggie zipp gallery greatoceanroadgrotto2 jpg  and  landscape   sample  www geocities com doggie zipp gallery greatoceanroadthe12apostles jpg   infinity  modes  while reviewing images or looking through menus  this button is used to move to the right   menu  button  brings up a variety of menus  which vary according to the shooting mode or review mode  the key features of this button are to adjust the  image resolution   1600 x 1200  1024 x 768 or 640 x 480  degree of  compression   superfine  fine and normal  with superfine representing the lowest compression and a higher quality image  changing the  iso   the settings available are 50  100  200  400  auto  and to set the  light metering mode   evaluative or spot metering to the right of the screen are three buttons  from top to bottom  these are the   display  button  used to turn the lcd on or off  or to display detailed information while shooting or reviewing images  in the latter case  this makes it possible to see what camera settings were used to capture an image  and then learn how to adjust the settings accordingly to achieve a better photograph in the future   exposure compensation    white balance    photo effect  and  erase  button  when shooting in bright daylight  or against a strongly backlit area  the  exposure  can be adjusted between  2  the captured image becomes darker  and 2  lets more light in and brightens the image  in 1 3 step increments   white balance  can be adjusted depending on the nature of the light source  some examples of which are  147daylight 148   147cloudy 148   147tungsten 148 and  147fluorescent 148  the  photo effect  is used to determine the characteristics of your final image  some photos will look more powerful in  147black and white 148  sample

between the following operating modes   replay   review the images that are stored on your cf card  this is the mode to use when you intend to download images from your camera onto your computer   auto   this shooting mode turns your camera into a point and shoot device  the camera does the light metering  iso settings and white balance automatically  this is the best mode to use if you need to take photos immediately after taking the camera out of its box  the downside is that photo effects such as  147sepia 148 are not available   program ae  p b  only the shutter speed and aperture size are set by the camera  other functions such as iso  white balance  photo effects and light metering are set by the user  i find this mode sufficient for all photos taken during the day   manual  m b  a mode for more experienced users  it allows for the manual adjustment of the  shutter speed   ranges from 1 1500 of a second for brightly lit scenes to 15 seconds for dimmer areas  and the  aperture size   a choice of two values between f2 8 and f14 are available at any zoom setting  the  manual  mode is fast becoming my favorite as it allows me to express myself  and is particularly useful for evening  sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 northbalwyneasternfreeway jpg  and nightshots   stitch assist mode   this intriguing feature allows the capture of a sequence of images  from left to right or vice versa  which can then be stitched together into a panoramic photo  samples  www geocities com doggie zipp gallery greatoceanroadlookout2panoramic jpg  with the  photostitch  software that is supplied with the camera  thus far  i 146ve created two panoramic images in this way  and i 146m impressed at how accurately the software can appose adjacent images   movie mode   the camera can capture short movie clips at about 20 fps  at a higher resolution of 320 x 240  the camera records for a maximum of 10 seconds  for longer movie clips  the lower resolution of 160 x 120 allows you to record clips up to 30 seconds long  recording ceases automatically when the time frame elapses  or if your cf card becomes full  whichever occurs first  the movies are also recorded with audio  making it handy for videoing short demonstrations the last  but not least  feature on this side is  zoom button  that is used to activate the digital and optical zoom  while reviewing images  the user can also use this button to magnify the image by up to ten times  and then panning across the image using the  left  and  right  directional buttons i the bottom  only the battery compartment cover and the tripod socket are seen in this area b software  two cds are included in the package  one being the  canon digital camera solution disk  and the other is the  arcsoft camera suite 1 1   the software is compatible with both windows and most macintosh operating systems  as mentioned above the  canon digital camera solution disk  includes   twain driver   a driver file that allows the computer to recognize your camera to allow for downloading of images   zoombrowser ex   the program allows the downloading of camera images onto the computer  organization in a chronological fashion to form a  time tunnel   images are arranged in a simulated tunnel  according to their creation date  which can be zoomed forward or backward as though one were moving through time  converting the camera 146s raw file format into bmp files  this function is redundant since all images on the camera are already in a jpeg format can be opened with  paint   and resize images to create email attachments   photorecord   the main feature of this program is to let the user create electronic photo albums  adding words to describe the image or a personal experience   photostitch   as mentioned before  the program takes the images  shot with the  stitch assist mode   arranges them  and turns them into a panoramic photo  it is accurate  and easy to use  the stitched edges are only vaguely apparent in areas where movement occurred while the photo was taken   remotecapture   when the camera is connected to your computer  the program lets you control the camera 146s shutter button and basic settings remotely from the computer  and images are downloaded immediately onto your computer instead of the cf card the  arcsoft camera suite  cd contains   arcsoft photoimpression   it can be described  quite simply as a jazzed up version of the regular  paint  program on your computer  with this  one can edit images by cropping it  enhancement  sharpen  blur e t c  or via the addition of special effects  the program is very functional and intuitive  and certainly much less of a pain to use than the comparatively primitive  paint    arcsoft videoimpression   this ingenious program allows the user to compile several short movie clips or still images into a movie with dramatic transitions  select from a list of dissolve  wipe  special or fancy effects  and also provides a feature for editing and removing any unwanted frames b conclusion  now that you 146ve come this far  let 146s summarize this review and get this over with as quickly and painlessly as possible i the good 133    excellent image quality   allowing the production of outstanding photos  every time   durable construction  ensures that the camera will outlast some of the tougher challenges   feature packed  yet easy to use  giving even the newest photographers a chance to get their hobby on the road   manual mode  leaves the user with lots of room to grow and experiment   software bundle  was well thought out  filled with features and very user friendly   noise reduction  system was exceptional and all the photos i took appeared to have little or no grain at all  the camera utilizes special processing techniques to reduce noise in images that are taken at shutter speeds slower than 1 3 seconds  this  however  requires a length of processing time which must elapse before the next image can be captured   instruction manuals  are well organized well presented i the bad and the ugly 133   i was shocked when i opened the box  only to realize this camera didn 146t come with a  camera case   since i was due to go sightseeing with my relatives immediately  i depended heavily on the wrist strap for a firm grip  the included  compactflash card  has a capacity of only 8mb  too small for its own good  i recommend purchasing a 64mb card  stores about 64 images  even at the finest quality  which is sufficient for longer trips away from home  it is unfortunate that no  rechargeable batteries  and  charger  were provided  a  four directional pad  instead of just a left and right button would 146ve made reviewing and panning through images a lot easier  the  lcd  is a little too small  even though this isn 146t a serious flaw  images are stored in a  jpeg format   a compression which results in a smaller file  but also causes the loss of some detail  i would have preferred the camera to store the image in a raw format  no detail is lost  which can then be converted to a standard bmp file on the computer   shutter lag  is quite noticeable  causing some delay  about 1 second  before another photo can be taken overall  this camera would make an excellent tool for beginners and hobbyists  but also leaves them with much room to grow  for its price  the  canon powershot a40  is surprisingly powerful and outshines many cameras in the 2 megapixel category  if you are new to the world of digital photography  this is the camera i 146d highly recommend b further reading  b

measured in increasing multiple such as  two times  three times and so on in  similar fashion to magnification  optical room this is  genuine room function that is performed with the aid of optical lenses there is no resulting loss of quality camera that have an optical room cost much more than those with only  digital room partly because of the additional moving parts  believe that even amateur photographer should purchase  camera with an optical room  note optical and digital room can be combined to achieve the maximum room on an image for example if  camera has   optical room and   digital room the total room is   fujifilm axis slimshot on th november which was the worst time to get distracted as my final had only just begun my attention was drawn to  segment of  brochure fearing this camera it was cheap when compared to other camera and extremely compact the credit card sized camera was only mm thick and had  decent internal memory of mb unfortunately it had no flash and no led screen two things which were deemed mandatory by  more experienced friend the camera also has no optical or digital room and captures  fixed images working out to  mere pipes or megapixels which makes it unsuitable except for the most casual of all photographer  today easyshare c the final exam was over on th november and  would have gone straight to the shops after leaving the examination hall if my sum had not held me back she told me to save my money instead the today easyshare c is an easy to use megapixel camera is endowed with   digital room and has  respectable storage capacity of mb this seemed attractive initially because it was well within my budget however the camera has no optical room once  had reached this stage my dad was convinced  had gone mad yet again though he didn  stop me he wasn  keen to watch me make  poor purchase and blow off hundreds of dollars in the process so he handed me some glossy brochure if you want to buy  camera make sure you do your research first said he  was glad  did  rich carlo or this was the third camera  researches though the pricking was  little over my budget its micro function intrigues me the camera can photograph objects as near as cm away from the lens the rich carlo or is surprisingly low prices considering it is  megapixel camera capable of  optical room and has negligible shutter law allowing it to capture images in rapid succession but research soon revealed that besides its micro mode fast shutter release and possibly the included rechargeable batteries there was little to recommend about this camera the images were noisy and were imbued with  strange blue tinge which was even more apparent in nightshots  canon powershot  it took  long while before  finally started searching on this camera  had ignored it initially because it seemed expensive when compared to other camera in its class and the mediocre information in the brochure pushed me to believe that this was an ordinary device with nothing to get excited about despite this canon proved the worth of this camera and eventually pocket my money  in brief the canon powershot  is  megapixel effective camera running on standard a batteries rather than proprietary ones with   optical room and   digital room function it features  manual mode which allows the user to control the shutter speed and aperture size and the interesting stitch assist mode for the production of panorama photo in addition to this the camera also boats  movie mode which allows the capture of short clips with audit it is most amazing to find this feature on  cheaper

future trips to farms or during clinical rounds  the top this is  relatively uninteresting side which features only the log powershot  and the shutter button the latter is also termed  two stage shutter release the industry standard when pressed halfway the camera focused on the image and adjust the white balance and exposure once this is done the camera bees the button can then be depressed fully to capture the image  the front when viewed from the front the battery compartment protrudes very markedly on the left but  find this increasingly useful as  handgrip the lens besides around the middle of this side and can be fitted with optional accessories such as the wide converted for taking wide angle when loomed out shots tell converted  magnifying lens to aid telephone when loomed in shots and the close up lens for taking micro shots this camera features  built in lens cover and eliminates the worry of losing it especially in haystacks such as those in my unkempt room the microphone is situated above the lens and records sound monaurally when the camera is in movie mode the optical viewfinder is position to the left of the microphone at the top right hand corner of the front face is the flash compartment which is constructed ingenious because it incorporated an orange red light that functions as an of assist beam helps the camera focus especially in dark conditions  red eye reduction lamp or  self time lamp while we are still viewing the camera from the front let  proceed to review the left and right sides  the left side there are few features on this side except for  compartment for the compactflash cf card and  separate compartment for  or battery this should last about three years from the date of installation if not more which functions to retain the date and time the wrist strap eyelid is position above the cf card compartment  the right side hidden underneath  unable rubber flap are three main features which  will discuss in order from top to bottom digital terminal when fitted with the included cable this port allows the camera to communicate with the computer via its us port overall communication speed are excellent   out terminal if the camera

switched between its and pal as required do in terminal with an optional adapted kit the camera can be connected to an external power source to allow extended use of the camera without having to stop to change the batteries  the back the screen is perhaps the most evident feature on this side it is  taft color led displaying images at  resolution of pipes this screen perform well under most conditions is brightly lit clear and allows an accurate review and framing of images under dimmler conditions the led begins to look grain but this has no effect on the final image the viable area is  mere cm and  was certainly expecting  larger screen on this camera the optical viewfinder rests above the led screen  rarely use this unless my batteries are running too low to turn on the led the two led indicator to the left of the viewfinder are used to remind the user of the current shooting mode warns that the camera is shaking or depict that the camera is busy underneath the screen are four buttons which  will discuss from left to right set flash button use it to set features in the various venus or to tongue between the flash settings when taking photo left direction button tongue

intriguing feature allows the capture of  sequence of images from left to right or vice versa which can then be stitched together into  panorama photo samples www geocities com maggie zip gallery greatoceanroadlookout panorama pg with the photostitch software that is supplied with the camera thus far  ve created two panorama images in this way and   impressed at how accurately the software can oppose adjacent images movie mode the camera can capture short movie clips at about fas at  higher resolution of  the camera records for  maximum of seconds for longer movie clips the lower resolution of  allows you to record clips up to seconds long recording ceases automatically when the time frame elapses or if your cf card becomes full whichever occurs first the moves are also recorded with audit making it handy for viewing short demonstrations the last but not least feature on this side is room button that is used to activate the digital and optical room while reviewing images the user

tried socket are seen in this area  software two cos are included in the package one being the canon digital camera solution disk and the other is the arcsoft camera suite the software is compatible with both windows and most mackintosh operating systems as mentioned above the canon digital camera solution disk includes twain driver  driver file that allows the computer to recognize your camera

in  simulated tunnel according to their creation date which can be loomed forward or backward as though one were moving through time converting the camera  raw file format into bump files this function is redundant since all images on the camera are already in  peg format can be opened with paint and reside images to create email attachments photorecord the main feature of this program is to let the user create electronic photo albums adding words to describe the image or  personal experience photostitch as mentioned before the program takes the images shot with the stitch assist mode arranged them and turns them into  panorama photo it is accurate and easy to use the stitched edges are only vaguely apparent in areas where movement occurred while the photo was taken remotecapture when the camera is connected to your computer the program lets you control the camera  shutter button and basic settings remote from the computer and images are download immediately onto your computer instead of the cf card the arcsoft camera suite d contains arcsoft photoimpression it can be described quite simply as  gazed up version of the regular paint program on your computer with this one can edit images by dropping it enhancement sharpen blur    or via the addition of special effects the program is very functional and intuition and certainly much less of  pain to use than the comparatively primitive paint arcsoft videoimpression this ingenious program allows the user to compile several short movie clips or still images into  movie with dramatic transitions select from  list of dissolve wipe special or fancy effects and also provides  feature for editing and removing any unwanted frames  conclusion now that you ve come this far let  summarize this review and get this over with as quickly and painlessly as possible  the good excellent image quality allowing the production of outstanding photo every time unable construction ensures that the camera will outcast some of the rougher challenges feature packed yet easy to use giving even the newest photographer  chance to get their hobby on the road manual mode leaves the user with lots of room to grow and experiment software bundle was well thought out filled with features and very user friendly noise reduction system was exceptional and all the photo  took appeared to have little or no grain at all the camera utilizes special processing technique to reduce noise in images that are taken at shutter speed slower than seconds this however requires  length of processing time which must elapse before the next image can be captured instruction manual are well organized well presented  the bad and the ugly  was shocked when  opened the box only to realize this camera didn  come with  camera case since  was due to go sightseeing with my relatives immediately  depended heavily on the wrist strap for  firm grip the included compactflash card has  capacity of only mb too small for its own good  recommend purchasing  mb card stores about images even at the finest quality which is sufficient for longer trips away from home it is unfortunate that no rechargeable batteries and charge were provided  four direction pad instead of just  left and right button would ve made reviewing and planning through images  lot easier the led is  little too small even though this isn   serious flaw images are stored in  peg format  compression which results in  smaller file but also causes the loss of some detail  would have preferred the camera to store the image in  raw format no detail is lost which can then be converted to  standard bump file on the computer shutter law is quite noticeable causing some delay about second before another photo can be taken overall this camera would make an excellent tool for beginners and hobbyists but also leaves them with much room to grow for its price the canon powershot  is surprisingly powerful and outlines many camera in the megapixel category if you are new to the world of digital photography this is the camera   highly recommend  further reading  digital camera resource page an excellent review on the canon powershot  http www resource com reviews canon

593;camera; when i first started looking a digital cameras  i didn t know that much about them  i am much more familiar with 35mm slr s and medium format cameras  i will try to pass on what i have learned and why i think the  hewlett packard photo smart c30  is a good deal when looking for a digital camera  i believe you need to look for several major features  the first of which is the resolution  or the amount of pixels that are contained in a photograph pixels are kind of like the the grain of a negative  the more pixels you have  the better the photo will hold together when you try to enlarge a photograph  the same is true with a negative  the more smaller the grain  or the more you have basically  the better the image enlarges  the hp c30 has one megapixel resolution  1152x872  this is the resolution at its highest setting  there are three settings on this camera  each setting progressively reduces the amount of resolution that a photo contains  this is a great feature when you are trying to save room on your memory card this leads to the second thing you need to look for when deciding on a digital camera  the memory of a digital camera is in essence the film you are shooting your photos on  some of the cheaper cameras do not have a removable or upgrade able memory card the hp c30 i bought came with a 8mb compact flash card  the memory card is about one and half inches square  this makes in convenient if you want to carry more than one card  the memory cards can also be bought with more memory allowing you to store more photos with out having to change the card or downloading images  you can store 17 superfine images  40 fine images  and 80 basic images another very important thing to look at when deciding which digital camera to buy is the way in which you download photos to the pc  the hp c30 is downloaded to the computer through you serial port  the camera comes with a 9 pin serial pc cable  this is slow process and i think it is the major drawback of this camera  a usb download would have been much more beneficial additionally  you want to be aware of the type of power source that it needs  if you buy a camera that is a battery guzzler  you can be out of luck when you really need it or want it  the hp c30 uses four aa batteries  if i buy good alkaline batteries  i get much longer use of the camera before i have to change them  hewlett packard estimates that the camera s battery life is like this  500 photos without a flash  and 200 photos with a flash  i would say that this a pretty good estimate lastly  in identifying a good digital camera in my opinion is what kind of accessories the camera comes with  this includes the software  this camera came with microsoft picture it  and hp photo smart photo finishing software  i personally love the hp software  it makes downloading the photos very easy  this program is also good when balancing color and exposure  another great part of this program is the way it allows you to print the photos  it s got a great feature called paper saver  allowing you get the most out of your photo printing paper one thing to look for is an lcd display  but i don t believe that it is as important  this is usually for a preview post view display  the hp c30 comes with a 1 8 quot  color display  although using it to take the picture is a little hard  this is due to the fact that it is not like a typical video camera image but refreshes the image every second  making the image appear to skip around another great feature of this camera is the fact that you can display your images on a television  the camera comes with a cable that can be hooked into the television  then you can slide show the photos in your camera  in addition  you can record the slide show onto a video tape to create easy and lasting memories  or to torment your family and friend with  i do recommend using the ac adapter while doing this so as not to drain your batteries b overall this is a great camera for the money b  i did buy this camera about a year ago  and at the time it was the biggest bang for the buck  i think in comparing digital cameras today that are available  that it is still is a great buy b here are the specs 1 megapixel resolution 2x digital zoom 24 bit color iso 100 exposure system mechanical shutter 1 500 to 4 seconds color 1 8 quot  lcd display normal focus 2  to infinity macro focus 10 quot  to 2 ntsc pal video connection dimensions 5 w x3 15 h x1 9 d in weight 68lbs  without batteries minimum host pc requirements 486 66 mhz or faster cpu  pentium recommended for nt 4 0 for use with microsoft windows 95 98 and nt 4 0 16 mb ram  32 mb recommended 20 mb available disk space for hp photosmart photo finishing software 80 mb available work disk space recommended 90 mb available disk space for creative software cd rom drive  4x speed recommended 256 color monitor  16 bit or higher recommended  br br  ;
